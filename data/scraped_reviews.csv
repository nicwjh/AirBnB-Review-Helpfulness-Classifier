12331902,14222179,Alain,"J'ai passé un trés agréable séjour dans l'appartement de Marcin. Dés le premier contact, Marcin s'est montré cordial et attentionné. Il a préparé mon arrivée avec soin, et j'ai trouvé un appartement trés propre, fonctionnel, avec un charmant jardin, mais aussi personnalisé et ""vivant"" avec des livres, des DVD...le plus que l'on attend d'un logement Airbnb.
Le logement est idéalement situé au sein d'une résidence sécurisée, dans un quartier calme et agréable, et proche de tout.
Je relèverai pour finir la gentillesse de Marcin que je n'ai malheurement pas rencontré, mais qui s'est toujours montré prévenant, poli, et joignable.",2016-05-14T02:14:45Z,5

16371887,2429313,Allen,"Manon's place was great! Checking in and out of the place was super easy. The apartment was clean and larger than expected. There's a washing machine for your clothes if needed. All the other essential amenities were there as well such as bath towels and toilet paper. The location was in a more quiet side of town though there are a couple of bars at the end of the block as well as a bakery right across the street. There's also a market next door for any essentials and larger ones 3-4 blocks away. Getting to places like the Louvre and Effel Tower required transferring once on the metro and generally took about 20-30 minutes to get to. We were able to wonder around the area and walked into the area of Bastille in about 20 minutes. If you're looking for a place that's a little less busy and lively, this is the place for you!",2019-09-30T13:08:10Z,5
16371887,7055547,Tege,"It was a pleasure staying at Manon’s apartment! Great central location in the happening 11th arrondissement, quiet, clean, good light overlooking a garden, with plants blooming in the springtime. I would definitely recommend her place!",2019-03-30T13:25:46Z,5

16371887,35154455,Victoria,"We really liked Manon’s apartment. It is in a really good location for the Marais and for the Canal St Martin/Oberkampf areas, and also close to two metro lines. What we really loved was how quiet it was, it looks over a peaceful internal courtyard garden. The photos don’t do justice to the main room, which is comfortable and well equipped. As others have mentioned, the loo cubicle is tiny, but it wasn’t a problem for us. We would happily stay here again.",2022-08-10T13:43:07Z,5

She was also very courteous and tried to help when there have been any kind of issues. So I can definitely recommend a stay at her place if you are a couple or at max 2 people.",2022-05-08T14:51:40Z,5

16371887,31282314,Ligia,"Manon' s place is amazing! We really fell in love with it!
It has everything you need and IT IS exactly like the photos. And still when we arrived we were positively surprised. It is full of light and the view to a small intenal garden is really soothing....
We (unfortunetely) didn't get to know Manon in person but she was always available to answer our queries. Check-in / Check-out was as smooth as it gets.
The shower and bed are great and the apartment is quiet at nights - that is ultra important when you are literally walking around Paris all day and need a place to relax and rest.
Her apartment is situated in a great neighborhood, close to 2 subway stations less than 5 minutes walking, supermarkets, boulangeries and cute little restaurants.
We would definitely recommend her place over, and over, and over again... :)",2018-05-15T12:09:25Z,5
16371887,13475213,Sidney,"We absolutely loved our stay at Manon's place! We were in Paris for New Years Eve and we were so happy with our decision to stay here. The apartment is a very close walk to the metro, which was super convenient for us and made it easy to get around, but also far enough away from the crowds and busy part of the city. The area was quiet and calm but had everything we needed (supermarkets, restaurants) and was right around the corner from Le Marais. The apartment itself had everything we needed! The kitchen was nice and modern, cute living room and a nice sized bedroom and bathroom. It was very clean and modern. The only slightest issues we had were trying to figure out the wi-fi and heater when we first arrived, but Manon responded to our email within minutes and was very helpful. We loved our stay here and would absolutely recommend it!",2018-01-02T13:56:07Z,5

Very convenient location by Le Marais, well-connected through 3  different subway stations that are less than a block away and also steps away from a supermarket. The host was very attentive and waited for us in the apartment until past midnight so we could check in after a late flight. Would definitely recommend it.",2017-10-08T12:42:45Z,5

27304845,261468656,Alexis,"Adorable studio apartment, good location, great patisserie just around the corner, monoprix just down the road. There’s also a street market on a couple days of the week, literally outside the front door of the apartment complex. Walking distance to the Eiffel Tower (just over 20 minutes) and metro stations all over to get everywhere else. 
 We loved our stay, and would definitely stay here again. 
 Just be prepared for the stairs, it’s a 4th/5th floor walk up. (Which I believe is noted, and was fine for us.  If you have difficulty with lots of stairs, you’ll need to look elsewhere)

I had a very relaxing stay here and would recommend it to anyone looking for a quiet place in a beautiful neighborhood. The area is wonderful because it isn’t crowded, and has everything you could possibly need. A very quick metro ride on line 11 will bring you to Republique and other major areas in Paris if that’s what you’re looking for. The bed is comfortable, the decor is cool, and there aren’t too many stairs to climb to reach the apartment, all in all it’s perfect and highly recommended!",2019-10-07T13:19:15Z,5

Though we didn't meet her in person, our communication over AirBNB was nice and her neighbour and a friend of hers took care of the keys. Hania also offered us a rather late checkout time in the afternoon, which was really convenient for us. All in all, we're really happy with our choice.",2017-11-06T12:57:14Z,5

He even followed up with us during the week to make sure everything was going well. The apartment was even more lovely in person than in the pictures. The living room skylight - amazing. The architecture and furnishings were perfect! Everything was in working order: the kitchen just right, the bathroom large and luxurious(think spa-like), the balcony a treat to sit on and watch the neighborhood in action. Street noise in the apartment - not an issue. And the black out shutters assured a great evening's sleep. For us, we were in the perfect location. Local cafes and bistros, markets, patisseries, and walking distance to just about everything. The Quatre de Septembre metro station literally outside the front door. What else to say? I hope to visit Paris with Alexandre's apartment as home base in the very near future! ",2015-10-08T14:27:36Z,5
3630731,5430539,Charles,"I have stayed at my fair share of airbnbs in Paris over the years, and Alex's apartment next to the Opera was by far the most enjoyable. On the top floor of a beautiful building with an elevator, the apartment has been fully renovated to expose the ancient structural rafters and add depth to the rooms. The charm is palpable.  There are multiple skylights and windows everywhere that bring lots of natural light into the apartment, not to mention the balcony that extends the full length of the apartment where you can get direct sunlight all morning. The apartment is very spacious, as listed in the description, and the bathroom is amazing with the largest shower I've seen in Paris. Alex keeps the apartment super clean so not recommended for messy people. Otherwise do not hesitate you will have an amazing stay. The closest metro (4 Septembre) is literally 20 steps from the entrance.",2015-05-30T13:41:10Z,5

9530275,295332229,阿漠,房东真的很好呀，去的时候有很多问题问她，她都回答的很快呀，所以入住还挺顺利的。房子位置真的很好呀，走路到卢浮宫就10分钟，不到10分钟就能到蓬皮杜中心，从CDG机场坐RER B可以坐到这里走10分钟就到了，就是如果行李很多的话爬楼梯真的挺累的，我们每人就一个背包所以感觉就还行，附近很多吃的，还有超市，买东西真的很方便。主要问题就是热水不够用啊，我们两个人洗，其中一个人容易洗不完。,2020-01-24T07:39:32Z,5

Pierre provided a folding bed for our two year old, which was an amazing help.  Very clean. 
One down-side is that the walls are thin and you hear the neighbours a bit but that’s the nature of an building on this age and I’m sure they heard and tolerated our toddler more than we heard them. 
We would certainly stay here again. ",2018-06-20T12:19:52Z,5

7910718,10831302,Kiran,"Incredible! The only word fit to describe both this host and the apartment you'll be renting. The apartment is on the 12th floor with amazing views of all of Paris. While the building goes up higher it's actually right in line with the top of the Eiffel Tower so you're literally on the perfect floor. I can't tell you how great it was to have coffee in the morning on the spacious balcony with beautiful views of all of Paris in the background. The apartment also has no less than 2 grocery stores (one organic and one traditional) both right as you step outside the building. It's also just about a two minute walk away from the Metro and a 5 minute walk away from Parc de la Villette (the third largest park in Paris) along with another park that is famous among local Parisians. 

Louis is an incredibly gracious and interesting host who did everything and more to make sure I had an enjoyable stay in Paris. If you're lucky enough to get to spend some time with him as I did it will only serve to enhance your overall experience of Paris. If you don't want to be in the main bustly and crowded tourist areas but want a real Paris experience and to live like a local, this apartment and host is the place for you. ",2015-11-17T11:46:03Z,5

The apartment was sparkling clean with all the amenities for my 4 week trip. The balcony is beautiful to watch the sunrise from the 6th floor. The elevator and in-unit washing machine were both life savers.

11848476,31441442,Daniela,Fabrice's place is exactly as described. Great location with lots to do around and close to train station if you decide to venture out to other neighborhoods. The apartment was cozy and after a day of exploring it was nice to have a comfy couch to sit on and decompressed.,2024-03-30T15:52:40Z,5

11848476,16547021,Summer,"Fabrice’s place is SPECTACULAR! The photos of the view of the Sacré Coeur don’t do it justice! I love Montmartre and this spot was right in the heart of things with lots of cute restaurants within walking distance and easily accessible metro stations. The stairs are no fun, but he’s very clear about that in the description and the view is well worth the climb! We were sad to leave but definitely hope to be back on our next visit to Paris. 

Fabrice was always available during our trip for questions and responded quickly. Overall 10/10 experience!",2024-02-14T15:57:50Z,5
11848476,186824870,Emily,"We loved our stay at this Airbnb! The host, Fabrice, met with us to show us how to enter and use all amenities. He even rescheduled around our hectic schedule due to one of our trains being cancelled at the last minute. Extremely welcoming and friendly. The view is amazing (photos really do not do it justice) and the apartment is clean and as described with everything you need. Prior to booking, be aware of the flight of stairs up to the apartment! Luckily we knew ahead of time and packed lightly, but I can see it being a bother with a lot of heavy luggage. Overall 10/10 for us!!!",2024-01-23T14:05:54Z,5
11848476,24747395,Sarah,"Fabrice’s place is wonderful! The location is super convenient- 3 min walk to the metro- and in a diverse and dynamic neighborhood. Being on the top floor the flat is absolutely quiet and peaceful, providing a perfect respite after time out and about in the city. It’s quite spacious by Paris standards, and very comfortable. And the view of Sacre Coeur out of all the windows can’t be beat - what a sight to wake up to! Fabrice was the perfect host- accommodating, flexible, friendly and communicative. He proactively checked in multiple times to make sure I was comfortable. 

Just know that the kitchen area is rather small if you intend to cook, and the stairs are real ;) The host graciously helped me with my luggage.",2023-12-20T12:59:22Z,5
11848476,71738765,Katherine,"The value for this place is phenomenal!!  The location & VIEW to Sacre Coeur is amazing.  The Montmartre neighborhood is with a 10 min scenic walk.  Metro access is 3 mins.  The space offers a great soaking tub - a luxury for sure.  Fabrice checked in on us regularly and addressed all questions quickly.  Regarding value - you won't find a nightly rate with this kind of access to all of Paris, you are in a multicultural predominantly African Neighborhood.  There are many people congregating on the side walks around the shops.  However, after reading history on the neighborhood I found it interesting to see the multicultural shops around us.  Within mins walking towards Sacre Coeur and Montmartre the landscape changes to traditional Parisian cafes and shops.  The 5 flights of stairs are curved & circular with angled and narrow steps.  We are in our 50's and 60's and managed it fine, but with bags it's tricky. Would we stay again?  YES!!",2023-12-02T12:36:38Z,5
11848476,38709298,Maya,Fábrice’s place was as described and had a lot of space to relax in after your long Paris days. The neighborhood was warm and friendly with lots of nice restaraunt a nearby. Perfect location to be out of city center and truly take in Parisian culture.,2023-11-27T13:25:35Z,5
11848476,64422038,Melissa,"Fabrice is friendly and helpful. He gave recommendations from the airport and met us at the door.  The description is accurate and it’s quite a  haul up to the apartment with luggage. Apartment is simple and clean.  The view is better than shown with sacre coeur from bedroom. The kitchen is for convenience only, not making large meals. Montmartre is a great neighborhood that makes Paris feels smaller and friendly.  Good food near apartment. Great art history nearby. There was building construction when we were there that was inconvenient but should make it nicer in the future. Near 2 metro lines that give good access to many major landmarks in the city center and some other nice areas.",2023-11-10T14:57:56Z,5
11848476,120212824,Bryan,"Fabrice was a thoughtful and responsive host. If you are someone who does not want to walk a lot of steps, I would keep that in mind for this place. It has a lovely view, but it is a commitment to get up to the stairs. It was great to stay in the Montmartre area. Getting on the metro to go wherever we wanted was very accessible.",2023-10-31T15:14:03Z,5
11848476,176069259,Peter,"Fabrice's place is very clean and comfortable, and the view is amazing. We enjoyed the neighborhodd: nice people, good restaurants and bakeries, and a short walk to the Sacre Coeur and the Metro. It was quiet at night since the windows face a courtyard, so sleeping was easy. It was a nice place to come back to after a day walking the streets of Paris.",2023-10-06T14:48:34Z,5
11848476,106938111,Jonathan,"What a charming apartment! The view really can't be beat. It is a climb up to the apartment as described, but it didn't bother us as we knew what to expect. The bed was super comfy as well.

Great neighborhood too - it's multicultural, with lots of different restaurants to try out, a few bakeries and grocery stores within 5 minutes, and just two blocks to the metro. 

Fabrice was very communicative - he met us at the apartment for check in, showed us how everything worked, and checked in to make sure everything was okay.",2023-09-19T13:43:23Z,5

11848476,428027462,Raymond,Great apartment with a stunning view!  Sebastian and Fabrice were welcoming and helpful hosts. We found the recommendations in the binder were excellent. The Bordeaux wine was an unexpected but highly appreciated bonus. The area is busy during the day but is surprisingly quiet at night.  Highly recommend Fabrice's apartment if you are looking for an authentic Parisian experience!,2023-07-15T13:40:25Z,5
11848476,170393439,Mariah,Fabrice and his team went above and beyond to make check in flexible and easy - he even helped us understand the city transit and directions better. There was a bottle of wine and a few beverages waiting for us when we got in which was a great touch. The place itself it wonderfully convenient and easily walkable to Montmartre and nearby a metro line that gets you anywhere in the city in 15-20 minutes. It’s spacious with great views of the Sacré Coeur. The only discrepancy is that is more located in the Goutte d'Or neighborhood or Little Africa vs Montmartre like the description reads. That didn’t really matter to us - just a few more minutes of walking. We would definitely stay again!,2023-06-30T14:51:01Z,5

The pictures don’t capture the beauty of the view of the Sacre Coeur from the windows on both levels.  We enjoyed coffee and croissant from the local Boulangerie in the morning and wonderful wine and cheese in the evening. Montmatre is fabulous and the metro provides easy access to the rest of of Paris. Fabrice was responsive and helpful.",2023-05-04T13:17:06Z,5

That's the home of somebody. Good amenities (I always love when there's a coffee cooker), nice and clean, very good location, good size for a stay of a few nights or longer. We didn't cook there, but it's certainly possible. Enough grocery shops in the neighbourhood, very nice bakeries. Amazing restaurant tips from Emilien, ask him, you will not regret it.",2019-09-25T14:27:18Z,5

There are loads of bars and cafes at your doorstop and the flat is conveniently located close to areas such as République and Le Marais. 
Emilien himself was really thoughtful and was always in contact to make sure that everything was going well during my stay.
The flat has all the necessary amenities and it’s clean and bright with loads of personal touches of its owners. 
Waking up in the beautifully lit room every morning made me feel like I was truly living this chic Parisian lifestyle! 
I highly recommend Emilien’s place.

Altogether, we had a lovely stay, communication and support were perfect with Johanna! Location is central, and if you're more than one person I would definitely recommend to go by uber or bolt (car sharing apps) from the airport to the place, it's faster and cheaper. Supermarkets, pharmacies, restaurants all nearby and if you want to explore the city there are also e-scooters you can use to navigate around. 
Thanks again Johanna.",2019-06-11T13:16:28Z,3

Johanna described us exactly how to get to the apartment. There was a description for interesting facts about the apartment, but also information about Paris. We felt very comfortable.
Johanna would have helped us with any concerns we might have, but she kept discreetly in the background. I personally felt it was perfect because we could be very independent. It felt like our own sweet apartment in Paris! 
I would come back at any time! :)

Clara was a great host - very accommodating and helpful. The information such as the wifi code etc was all laid out very clearly in a welcome book.
The apartment had lots of security with 2 door codes to get into the building. The location was good for me as I could walk to Nation in about 10-15 minutes and get the direct line to Concorde where I was working every day.

The apartment is located a block away from a G20 supermarket, restaurants and cafe's, and there is easy access to the Metro.   

The nespresso coffee machine, and the small clothes washer in the kitchen made it easy to feel at home.  We loved staying at her apartment, and hope to enjoy her hospitality again in the future!

The location is good: close to transit, groceries and restaurants. As others have mentioned, it is up 5 flights of stairs. There is a lift being installed but not sure when it will be finished. The apartment is in a lively neighborhood so can be noisy at night. Otherwise, great value. Thanks Lou!",2018-09-19T13:32:36Z,4

18467063,101576345,Young,"Felt like I was a real Parisienne for 5 days. Beautiful and cozy room. I was lucky to stay at Lou’s spacious apartment with almost everything I need. Located in residential area, 5 to 8 minutes walk from metro, and I’m personally a Tour Eiffel lover, so that the metro goes straight to Trocadero without transfer was a good thing. If you have a large, heavy luggage, it might be a little workout time to walk up the stairs. But I think the apartment is working on building the elevator at the moment I was staying. I loved Lou’s apartment a lot. I’ll definitely come back. Highly highly recommend.",2018-06-06T14:37:08Z,5
18467063,2317114,Maeve,"Lou's place was amazing! The location is great, near so many things but still on a quiet street which made for great sleeping on a comfortable bed.

Really easy walk from Gare Du Nord and good transport options to get around the city. Also close to supermarkets and boulangeries for grabbing fresh bread for breakfast if you want to save money on eating out. The kitchen had everything I needed for meals and was new and stylish! The only downside is the street below can be a bit noisy during the day, but it was quiet at night and had a great night sleep!

The apartment was very clean, has loads of space for two people and loads of natural light, the photos don't really do it justice! We stayed for a weekend in November and the apartment was a warm and cosy home.
The location is great - a short walk from Gare du Nord (so easy for the Eurostar) and close to metro stations, making it quick and easy to get to most popular areas and sights. The road the apartment is on is full of shops and cafes, but was very quiet inside the apartment, on the top floor of the building.

I did not want to leave Noémi's apartment; I could have stayed there my entire trip! I have no complaints, and it's honestly the best Airbnb I've ever stayed at. Also, I had the pleasure of meeting Noémi – she is so kind, a beautiful human being with a lovely soul. She recommended great places for me to visit in the neighborhood.

Need a code or key fob to get in, so building is secure. Her place is clean and well-appointed. Pictures are accurate. There is a loft and a nice pull-out sofa.  Although we ate our meals out, kitchen seems well-stocked. Bathroom was very clean.  As Noemi notes, construction being done to facade but no work is done over weekend. 

Location is perfect!  Can walk to Notre Dame in 10-15 mins. Metro close by to get to other sites.  The apartment is about 1/2 block from bar/restaurant so can get noisy at night if window is open.  

Noemi was very responsive to any questions that came up.  I would not hesitate to stay here again. I highly recommend her place. ",2018-08-12T14:16:39Z,5

The small kitchen worked well for us and was well stocked with all we needed. The shower was good, plenty of hot water. 
We were in Paris for 5 days and for most of them we walked to the M4 metro and caught the train to St Michael’s fountain which took around 20mins in total. 
Sarah checked in on us via the Airbnb app to see if we were okay. Being able to stay till 14:00 on the day of departure was really helpful.

An easy single flight of stairs up to the apartment-even a small lift for heavy luggage.  The neighborhood felt very safe- bustling during the day, but quiet at night. Very diverse assortment of good restaurants in walking distance- all price ranges. You can rent a bicycle just a few feet from the front door (highly recommend)- and there are a couple of great coffee shops and a delightful Patisserie within a 2-3 minute walk.

17122475,6737722,Sofie,"Our stay at Claire & Jean-Baptiste's apartment exceeded all our expectations. A friend and I booked a weekend trip to Paris quite spontaneously and were very happy that we found this little gem a few weeks in advance. 
First of all, the location is prime! There are dozens of cool restaurants, cute cafés and hip bars just a few steps away from the apartment, actually we were so overwhelmed with the choice that we barely couldn't bring ourselves to leave the neighborhood to explore more of Paris, haha! It is also very close to several metro stops as well as to two main train stations (Gare de l'Est and Gare du Nord) and various bus stops, so you can reach about every corner of the city easily. However, since the neighborhood is so cool and there is lots to explore on the way, we almost always walked to a lot of sites, which is also totally doable. The apartment itself is equipped with everything you need; towels, blankets, glasses, coffee! I would like to outline that I have never stayed in a cleaner airbnb, or one that had such awesome thoughtful details like fresh flowers! We never met Claire and Jean-Baptiste, because they were not in the city on this particular weekend, but they left us a list with all the info and communication concerning check-in and keys was organised by them in advance and smooth. They checked on us several times during the weekend to make sure we were ok, which I found very nice and not self-evident.
And, last but not least: the little balcony with views over the roofs of Paris was magical and brought us a lot of joy. 
Honestly, stay here if you can, it doesn't get better than this. 
Thank you Claire and Jean-Baptiste!",2017-11-05T13:22:42Z,5

Not only has the apartment been recently redone with new kitchen and bathroom appliances (a rarity in Paris), but the place is spotless, stylishly yet homily decorated, and literally above a metro station. I had never stayed in the 19th arrondissement before and found the neighborhood a nice change from the typical hustle and bustle of central Paris - it's quiet, next to a beautiful canal, and a quick metro ride to everywhere else. I'm so thankful I found this gem and will definitely be back the next time I'm in Paris!",2019-05-30T14:25:44Z,5

The apartment is a bit out of the way of central Paris but nevertheless there was a metro station right outside the apartment, so that was convenient. I might suggest bribing slippers as the floor is old and there was no bath mat but apart from that it was a good stay🙂",2019-05-17T11:40:29Z,4

There were many restaurants very nearby, and an organic market across the street with nice wines! The metro is right outside the front door!

The location of the place is just great and the place itself looks exactly like the photos of it. It can be a little cold in the evenings in spring, but during the day it gets warmer since there is a lot of sun and light coming through big windows. Some kitchen stuff is available, but you should ask for it. The bathroom is little but it has everything you need. The place is cozy  and it was a pleasure to come there in the evenings. 

Checking in is easy: we met on specified time and it was easy to find a place. Checking out is even easier: we just leaved the keys and slammed the door.",2019-05-09T11:31:14Z,4

It's a short walk to the metro, and from there, the whole of Paris awaits you.

We managed to walk from the location to the Notre Dame, as well as the Place de la Bastille, so everything in the first through the fourth districts are walkable, although the first (the Louvre) would be stretching it.",2017-04-02T09:05:33Z,4

5781559,145427597,Jeffrey,"Terrific apartment in the heart of the Left Bank, great location with easy access to everything from Denfert-Rochereau. Spacious and comfortable with an unusually superior sofa bed in the living room for visitors. It's an older building and the shower and washing machine have a loud suction pump that evacuates their runoff. Well-equipped kitchen that lacks only an oven, more than made up for by the unusual and much-appreciated addition of a separate freezer and fridge. I would rent it again.

Camille was an excellent landlord. We had unexpected catastrophes that were not at all his fault. First a pipe leaked in the w/c in the apartment, and after it was fixed, there were unrelated leaks from the upstairs apartment and it was raining into my w/c. In each incident, Camille responded immediately and came with the plumbers the same day. He always did everything he could to fix problems as quickly as possible. Whoever rents this apartment next will be fortunate to have a newly remodeled bathroom with the same attentive and dedicated landlord.",2018-09-01T14:40:15Z,5

The apartment is just the right size for a traveling couple, and VERY convenient to both the Metro and the Train lines.  The neighborhood is lovely, with a number of places to eat and shop within just a few blocks.  Camille left us a bottle of wine which we appreciated after a long day of sightseeing, and also some very useful information books about Paris for visitors.  The apartment was filled with Camille's travel books and although they were in French (of course) and we don't know French enough to read them well, they were fun to look at since we love travelling as well. Also she has a large selection of DVD's so if you want an evening of rest, there is plenty to watch.  All the essential kitchen and bathroom amenities were provided.

5781559,32281280,Kira,"We stayed here for 6 days and this apartment was great.  It's a little south of the river - about a 40 minute walk - but right on two metro lines and the RER train that goes to Charles de Gaulle airport, so extremely convenient.  We had no problems getting around to all of the traditional tourist sites, although since it is a bit further south we found that we never came back to the apartment to change clothes for something like a nicer dinner.  The apartment itself is very nice - there is a large kitchen/living area with TV, sofa and kitchen table, a good sized bedroom and separate shower and toilet areas.  All in all, very cute, very comfortable, very clean - everything you would need for a short stay.  The apartment is on the second floor (European second floor, so third floor in the US) and there is no elevator - just something to keep in mind if you aren't good with stairs or have very heavy luggage. In terms of neighborhood, there is a terrific bread/pastry shop right on the corner and a great street with lots of stores specializing in bread, cheeses, meats and fruit nearby.  The Catacombs are a 5 minute walk, and the Montparnasse cemetery is about a 10-15 minute walk.

Camille herself is wonderful.  She is extremely responsive - she confirmed the booking the same day we requested it and a few days before we arrived in Paris she sent detailed instructions on how to get to the apartment.  She was out of town, so she arranged for a friend to let us in and give us final instructions on letting ourselves out of the apartment at the end of the trip.  Camille had left for us a map of the neighborhood and instructions on everything we might need while in the apartment (where the clean sheets were, how to use the TV, etc),  and also given us small tourist guides for Paris, a bottle of wine and a bag of French nougat (amazing).  She even cleared out a few shelves in her closet so we would have room for our clothes, and let us know we could use any of the cooking staples she had at the house, saving us from having to buy basics like oil, seasonings, butter, etc.  She really went out of her way to make our stay comfortable without even being there!",2015-05-27T14:25:20Z,5

22324502,81190225,Araceli,"Simon is very kind and helpful.  I appreciated how quickly he replied each time I had a question.

Because he had no tenants immediately before or after our stay,  he let us check in early and check out late — very convenient for us.

We had never stayed at an AirBnb where the host lives.  We appreciate the trust, and especially leaving us enough coffee / tea / drinks in the fridge, and some snacks. The only thing that could be inconvenient is having only one key to the place but he did say the building manager could keep the key within certain hours.

Conveniently accessible to 3-4 Metro stations, a hip neighborhood vibe, boulangeries to choose from, several cafes / bars and brasseries, grocery store and street market also close by.",2018-09-16T12:25:23Z,4

Elio had also made a list with nice restaurants, local food markets, the best bakery etc.. The neighborhood is super cosy, right behind Sacré-Cœur.

About the flat, I traveled with my mum, and I think this flat is perfect for two. It’s really small like all Parisian flats, but it was just perfect for one week stay. 
Mika provided us with everything we need during the stay like maps and breakfast, bathroom products, so nice. 
The only minus was no space to put our clothes, there was no wardrobe and flat was full of private things, so there was no space to organize our stuff, except one table.
The location is amazing, in one of my favourite parts of Paris, full of local restaurants and coffee spots and just 10 min walking from Notre Dame. And there is delicious bakery and two supermarkets close to the flat.
So I would definitely go back there in the future!",2018-10-01T12:34:29Z,5

Note that there is no AC so if you get hot at night, definitely pack lighter clothing. It’s on the first floor so you can sometimes hear people below, but it didn’t bother me or keep me up.",2023-08-24T11:11:14Z,5

The apartment is in a great location just 5 mins from the Sacre Couer and 10 mins from the closest metro stop that'll get you to the city center. It's located on a street with tons of restaurants and bars, though this does mean that there is noise at night (Elena & Yohann had a fan that I used to drown out the noise).

Il suo appartamento è piccolo ed accogliente. Ha tutto il necessario per un breve soggiorno. La posizione è comodissima: vicino a metro, RER e autobus di collegamento per l’aeroporto Beauvais. Si raggiungono facilmente a piedi arco di trionfo e Champs-Élysées. L’unica nota negativa é stata la pulizia, soprattutto il bagno non era molto curato.",2018-09-17T12:11:15Z,5

12816149,24987026,Arminda,"This is the perfect apartment for a city trip. The location of Jerome's place is fantastic and very close to all of Paris main attractions. We loved that the area have shopping stores restaurants and supermarket around the corner where you can get anything you might need during your stay.
Most listings we saw didn't have a full kitchen, so we appreciated that this one did, plus a washing machine which was a lifesaver. The apartment is located on a quiet side street, but it's possible to walk to the mayor landmarks with in 15-30 minutes walking distance. They provide a map of the surrounding areas and 
recommendations on things to do.
There is a nice courtyard that isn't mentioned in the listing with a amazing history to tell. We loved the small details like free drinks in the fridge on arrival.
The WiFi is strong, so my husband could do his Zoom calls
without any issues.

EVERYTHING you need is at your fingertips, even a washing machine and drying rack.

Jerome’s mother, Jacqueline, was the one that helped us check in. She gave us a great introduction to the apartment and the information binder that she left was also very helpful. We ran into her husband a few times and had some lovely chats with him as well.",2022-05-21T12:03:10Z,5
12816149,12997985,Linda,"I had a really lovely time staying here! Jerome’s mother Jacqueline handled the communication and checkin/checkout, and it was all very easy and efficient. The location is wonderful - right off Saint-Germain - close enough for easy walking  to many places and shops (as well as several metro lines) but also quiet at night. Building is very safe and secure and made me feel almost like I lived in Paris! Bonus that it’s on the first floor, a nice break if your legs are tired after walking around all day - no need to climb a bunch of stairs each day. The rate was comparable to hotels with similar location / conveniences - of course with the extra perks of having a full kitchen if you like to cook or need to refrigerate/reheat any delicious leftover food (for me, not the former but definitely the latter). Full sized bed plus couch in the living room. There were lots of perks I didn’t even use (no need for me to watch TV or make phone calls on this trip), good for lots of types of travelers. Jacqueline was so lovely and kind, and she even offered for her/her husband to show me around, but I already had a very full itinerary - but maybe next time around. I couldn’t have asked for more!",2022-05-01T13:28:36Z,5

Jerome's mom, Mme Raynaud, living right above, was always there for me and helped me in many ways. So I didn't feel alone.
Even though it is located on the ground floor, I felt comfortable to leave windows open.  Furniture were not new, but there was everything i needed.  I could manage fine.  Overall I had a great stay.

The internet worked well most of the time (we worked remotely while staying there), and there are multiple workstations in the apartment so we had our space to work and have meetings separately.

The place would have been near impossible to find, but luckily due to Ines thorough instructions & quick response times it was a breeze! The building itself is very outdated, with the stairwell insulation coming off the walls and very dark to get home at night. The actual Airbnb though was immaculate! When we couldn’t figure out the key fob, Ines responded instantly that we just needed to use a different color. When we couldn’t figure out the washing machine, Ines responded instantly to help troubleshoot what was going on to fix it. The location was very accessible to all public transportation, with several activities even within walking distance. She provided the most comfortable bed, and the only washer, that I found in the entirety of my stay in 4 different European countries.

The apartment is located in very Centre of Paris and it was very comfortable. The apartment is small, but has all necessary amenities. It was like on the photos, just you should note that there are no photos of entrance. The building is old and needs good renovation as entrance is very old and looks bad. Also  there are steps to climb.

The neighbourhood is great, 5 minute walk from my favourite parts of le marais, and so close to the seine, as well as being surrounded by metro stops.
The Apartment was really homely and cosy, and their little cat was cute and not a problem to deal with- also very friendly with strangers (and I'm not a cat person). All the neighbours we met were really friendly as well, which always makes you feel safe. There were cute little love heart shaped notes around the apartment too with details on how to use things etc. Love that touch!
I would defiantly recommend these hosts for users going to Paris!

The location is amazing, only footsteps from Rue Montorgueil (an eat street with lots of restaurants/cafes/bakeries/etc) as well as close to the metro or walking distance to other main tourist sites. There are 2 locked doors so you feel very safe. There is a kitchen so you can cook your own food. Katia makes check in/check out and all communications very easy in french or english.

14949361,14079041,Teri,We loved staying at Katia's apartment. The location couldn't be better - the Montorgueil neighborhood is our absolute favorite spot in Paris. It has a really dynamic ambiance and there are loads of great restaurants. The apartment itself is great - super quiet and calm (essential when you need to get some work done) and equipped with everything you need to cook 'at home' and relax.,2017-06-24T11:17:56Z,5

14949361,1395358,Zann,"Katie's place is cosy, comfy & located along the lively streets of Montorgueil. It's about 5-10mins walk from many metro stations (Sentier, Les Halles, Etienne Marcel, Reaumur-Sebastopol) so pretty accessible to all places/attractions. Lourve museum itself is about 15mins away from foot.

Plus point is it's alley from Montorgueil is well-lighted so we felt quite safe even to go back later in the night! :D

Everything you need (kitchen, cooking utensils, fridge, hair dryer) in a house is also available. 

Would definitely be back again if I'm back in Paris!",2016-11-22T10:41:34Z,5

Yun answered very quickly and was welcoming. I did not have any problems with communication. Espessially want to say about the area - this is a typical district of Paris with beautiful Parisian buildings - with cafes, boulangerie, shops and the market on certain days. It is very calm and non-touristic. This, of course, takes some time to get to the center, but the opportunity to feel like a Parisian is worth it.  We would like to stay here again.

There were a few missing amenities (such as dish soap or a garbage pail), and there was occasional noise from the neighbors in the courtyard, but overall not too much of a problem.  We had some problems with the washing machine but Arnaud was nice about it, and he was very responsive to our questions.

We did not have the opportunity to meet them as they were travelling, but they were thorough in their communication before our arrival and their concierge, who was absolutely lovely, checked us in. There are so many places to stay in Paris, and we had booked this apartment after our original booking had cancelled in the few weeks before we were due to arrive- I think this apartment was ultimately better than what we had originally booked. It was as listed- the area was great, lots of restaurants, cafes and grocers near by, very well connected to the metro, building was really secure. We walked from the apartment to the river in about 40 mins. There was also some lovely perfume and toiletries waiting for us upon checking in, a really welcoming touch. My friend and I utilized the bedroom and pull out couch and both were very comfortable sleeps. We had no issues at all during our stay, it was really lovely.

There is a mini-mart, some grocery stores and the lovely Marche Saint Martin within walkable distance, along with some cute wine bars and restaurants. The famous Le Pain Des Idees is a nice stroll in the morning, and so is the Canal St. Martin area. We are happy to have found this little gem in beautiful Paris",2018-02-21T14:39:24Z,5

We were 2 people and the apartment has the right space for us. The bed is comfortable even for tall people, couldn't say the same about the washing basin, but still it created no troblues.
The shower is nice and quite wide, the kitchen is abslutely well furnished, if you're not used to electric kitchen you should better ask instructions when you arrive, but it is easy.
The location really is nice as Nathalie says, you just need to get out at the right metro station and you'll find a nice area with venues and bistrot. There is also a small but nice market near there and a bakery.
Metro stations are close and get you everywhere you want in Paris.
I definitely reccomend Nathalie's apartment.",2017-05-02T12:59:14Z,5

The place is full of beautiful decor and great little details, and the apartment is full of light. It's a bit on the small side, but perfectly fit our needs - between the bedroom, the bath, the living room and the little kitchen.
The neighborhood is quiet and residential - you'll be a bit far from the main tourist attractions, but you'll get to experience a local neighborhood feel, with plenty of little local shops, including a Boulangerie right in the building. 
Marie-Sophie was super helpful with all of our needs - helping out with instructions from the airport, and providing us with an iron and hairdryer which we requested. 
I'd highly recommend staying with her!",2015-11-09T13:02:31Z,4

The house is a perfect size, bigger than what one may typically find in Paris. Very comfy feelings but at the same time does not feel like you are living in someone else's house. Big comfy bed and nice kitchen. I did not use it to cook, but the island was nice to sit at and do some reading with an open window. There is also a courtyard in this apartment complex. Bathroom is nice and clean as well. 
Area has some food by it, but as with all things Paris you need to walk around. I could not tell you what major landmarks are nearby or any famous bars, but there are a lot of cafes and bars in the area. Garden of Luxemburg is about a 15-20 minute walk away and the metro is only a 4 min (max) walk. Overall great experience and would do it again. ",2016-07-02T04:41:14Z,5

18164817,19047602,Ammy,"We book the apartment just few hours before arrival. 

Paolo was easy to talk to and he was waiting for us when we arrived after 10pm. 
He gave us 2 sets of keys to make things even easier for us ( we where in Paris for work) .

The apartment is located between metro Rome and metro Villier , really nice and secure neighbourhood with plenty of restaurants, shops, bakeries... just 4 stops from Opera. 

The space has 2 rooms, the first one as you enter the flat is the kitchen, with microwave, stove, kettle, fridge and cuttlery. Opposite a little bath room with a shower (good water presure and really clean) and the main room with a double bed ( really comfy) a little sofa and a coffee table. He left shower gel, shampoo, towels and also offered us to use whatever was in the flat. 

Things to take in consideration there is no internet and the flat is located in the 4rth floor ( no lift)
 
The flat is small but has everything you need and Paolo was an excelent host.

I would totally come back to Paolo's home.",2017-10-04T13:18:36Z,5

I think the apartment is even better than on the pictures, very cosy. 
It was really nice to chill, drink tea and listen to the radio in the living room. The bathroom is so pretty and the bedroom very romantic. When in the bedroom we can hear a bit of noise from the street but nothing too disturbing.

We struggled a bit with the bed, as it is a fold out couch it was very uncomfortable and made a LOT of noise every time someone moved therefore waking the other person up. Loud, thumping music from the bar below also made for difficult sleep.
There was no hot water for the duration of our stay however I'm not sure if that was to do with the apartment or the works going on outside.
However, over all the apartment was a good space to have as our base and Elisabeth put in extra effort to ensure the apartment was equipped with extras like toiletries and coffee.

7449256,13515506,Thibaut,"We stayed at Antoine's place for 4 nights this summer. The apartment is super pleasant, on the 5th floor in a nice Parisian building with elevator. The neighborhood is great with many shops, bars and restaurant at direct proximity.

The host was extremely responsive, check in was really smooth as someone was there to give us the keys and explain everything to us. The place is exactly as described in the pictures. 

The only small thing is that the internet turned out to be unreliable, but the host was in the process of fixing that, and accommodated us with a wifi/4G dongle as we were staying there.

I recommend staying at Antoine if you are visiting Paris.

7449256,6618237,Aaron,"My girlfriend and I had the most enjoyable stay at Antoine and Margot's apartment! We felt like staying in most of the time even though it was our first trip to Paris. The location of it was within less than a minute walk to Ménilmontant Metro station.

There were plenty of amenities in close vicinity such as a supermarket and good places to eat. Check in was very smoothly handled by Antoine's friend even though we were held up by traffic for quite some time. 

Communication with Antoine prior to our stay was clear and friendly! He also left recommendations and followed up very quickly with good places to visit with instructions on how to get there during our trip. 

The interior of the apartment was exactly how the pictures depicted it! It was even more charming than expected and it was extremely cosy and bright! Wifi was also very reliable and speedy. We couldn't think of a better place to stay in if we visit Paris again!

Overall, an excellent stay and I would recommend this place. ",2015-10-02T12:31:00Z,5

There is a stop of metro just in front of the building. Below there is a Macdonalds and several nearby supermarkets. 

The neighborhood is quiet and on Tuesdays and Fridays you have a market. 

Antoine is very attentive. Let us planes of the metro, some tips on the neighborhood and drinks in the fridge. We had many facilities to pick up and leave the keys in the apartment when we wanted to.

Accommodations were small but tidy, exactly as you’d expect for a Paris flat, and everything was exactly as advertised. Natalie welcomed us with a few things in the fridge and pantry, answered questions about a nearby laundromat (200 yards away), and was extremely accommodating about a late checkout. Notable: the owners clearly live in the flat, which was totally fine for us, but since many AirBnBs hardly seem lived in, its worth noting. They also apparently have a cat (not on the premises during our stay) Again, not an issue for us, but worth knowing.",2019-07-01T13:32:52Z,5

The location of the apartment was ok for us as we were arriving and leaving Paris by Gare de l’est (otherwise, I would have probably chosen a different location). The apartment was ok. Natalia has all the necessary stuffs in kitchen to cook you meals. That was great! The apartment was a bit disorganized and I was expecting more cleanliness. However, what I have learnt after 4 times Airbnb in Paris is that the order/cleanliness average of an Airbnb in Paris is much lower than in other European cities. If you really care about cleanliness then you need to pay a 5 stars hotel or a very fancy Airbnb. As I plan to continue going to Paris, I really hope to find someday an excellent Airbnb experience.",2019-05-20T11:08:29Z,3

We arrived late at night and had no problems finding it or accessing the address which is in a courtyard behind the main street. Natalias place is wonderfully eclectic. She is an artist, philosopher and film maker according to her book collection! I was there with my daughter for her birthday and she thought it was wonderful to stay in an apartment that someone actually lives in rather than a rental or a hotel.It has a beautiful patio area in which you can have breakfast if the weather is good. Natalias place has everything you need for a stay in Paris and there are supermarkets and cafes very close, as well as easy access to the Metro system for exploring Paris. I would recommend Natalias place to anyone who is visiting Paris, her commmunication in setting up the booking was really good and one of her family members was there to let us in when we arrived which was really nice.

There’s a dishwasher, but it needs servicing. The only window and sliding glass door don’t function properly and really need to be replaced. The large terrace could be a wonderful additional living space, but as it is, it’s unwelcoming.

It was such fun coming out of the apartment everyday right into the bustling market. You're a few minutes walk from Place de la Bastille, and very close to Metro (Ledru Rollin, line 8, or Bastille, multiple lines.) The apartment itself is small (in American standards) but very comfortable and lovely. We were two people (a couple) and it was very comfortable for us. (apartment is ideal for 1 person or a couple; less good for two room mates because there is only one bed.) Excellent value for money.

I never had to spend more than 30 minutes to get anywhere I needed to go in Paris.  There were 2 subway stations nearby convenient for getting into central Paris. 

I was initially skeptical when I booked this Airbnb because of the low number of reviews, but I trust Emilien’s listing will soon become a popular place to stay because it was exactly what I needed.  I recommend his spot if you want the true experience of being in Paris, especially a cool neighborhood.

The terrace is amazing, and the flat tiny but very functional. Don't take the 'family friendly' and 'breakfast' promises too seriously though, it simply means it's OK to be a family and to have breakfast at the place. There is no crib/matress (we knew that in advance but still) and no breakfast! ",2016-09-17T07:25:52Z,4

Also you can reach the center of Paris and Montmartre on foot.Close by is also a supermarket, bus stop, cafes, restaurants, and even convenience stores. The apartment is very bright and well ventilated. On the stairs there is an elevator. It's pretty small, but I liked to ride it. Before my arrival, Jacques did the cleaning, so it was not a problem.

Le quartier est très agréable e bien situé (metro, commerces... a proximité). Nous avons été un peu décus par l'appartment cependant qui n'était pas très propre avec un frigo qui était inutilisable (les produits à l'intérieur  avec des traces de moisissure). A noter que l'appartement est également un appartement ""fumeur"", donc avec une odeur particulièrement forte et présente qui est restée sur nos vêtements suite à notre séjour. Par ailleurs, nous avions de sérieux doutes sur la fraicheur des draps que nous avions (nous y avons retrouvé des cheveux, une chaine cassée...). Bref, la contact avec la personne et le quartier étaient positifs, mais l'appart ne valait certainement pas les 50€ par nuit par rapport à sa qualité (rapport qualité/prix négatif). 
J'espère que ce commentaire permettra à Jacques de s'améliorer.",2015-05-26T17:08:14Z,2

The location is close to some very nice little bars and cafes, a lovely meat, fish and vegetable market and a superb bakery right on the corner! The sacre coeur is just a 10 min walk and is surrounded by an abundance of cafes and restaurants. The Eiffel Tower can be walked in an hour but the chateau rouge metro is a stone's throw away. Will definitely return!",2020-01-05T12:50:38Z,5

The kitchen is well equipped, so we could prepare our breakfast every morning with no troubles! The bathroom is quite small, but totally expected for Europe standards, especially for Paris. The apartment is located close to a metro station and several bus stop that helped us a lot in our stay during transport strike! Communication was really easy going, with a little miss understanding in the check in due to strike, but at the end everything went well.
I would recommend Léa’s apartment and I would definitely consider to stay in there again on a next time in Paris.",2020-01-03T13:56:31Z,4
29625339,35616892,Hilde,"Léa is a great host! She was very attentive and picked up the phone immediately when I didn’t know how to find the right name on the electronic doorbell. We asked her questions on several occasions during our stay, and she was always quick to respond. 

The apartment is beautifully and tastefully decorated, with a mix of European style furniture, modern art work, stacks of books, and some African touches, like fabrics used in decorative pillows, art work  etc, reflecting the area’s multicultural vibe. (I bought some beautiful wax fabrics in the shops in the area). 

The apartment is spacious, especially the living/dining room, and has a separate bedroom with a double bed (don’t expect king size - this is a beautiful old building, so a king size bed would barely fit there. It’s more like a queen size, I would guesstimate). The bed is comfortable, though a little soft for my liking, being used to a very sturdy mattress. 

The kitchen is fairly small but it’s laid out efficiently and is well-equipped, so you could cook a full meal there without any issues if you wanted to. We did have issues cleaning up, because we couldn’t find any dish towels... perhaps an oversight in the last cleaning session. 

Speaking of cleaning - the apartment was very clean! I have severe dustmite allergies, and I did not have to take any extra medication while there, which is very rare when I don’t bring my allergy covers for the bedding.

The bathroom, like in most homes from this era, is tiny - it’s built into what for American homes would be a smallish walk-in closet. I’m a little over 5’8” and I’m about a European size 44 (American size 12 to 14), and I can imagine if you’re much bigger, you’d have problems maneuvering between the toilet, the tiny sink, and the door. The shower works well. Of course, in a building this age, you don’t have much room to work with. We did have an issue with the toilet seat that was caused by the previous guests, and unfortunately Léa had not been able to fix it before we arrived. She was very open and apologetic about it, and we didn’t mind too much. She mentioned that she was meeting a contractor on the day of our departure to discuss improvements for the apartment, so I imagine the place will be even lovelier for the next guests! 

The apartment is a wonderful reprieve from the busy city. It is located close to a very lively shopping area with lots of international shops and a small market. The latter unfortunately does cause some trash to be left on the street in the area, which is a shame, because the buildings are lovely on the inside. But don’t let that deter you from staying at this lovely apartment! The shop keepers and the people in the area were all very lovely and welcoming, and the place is only about a 10-15 minute walk from the Sacré Coeur and Montmartre. I wouldn’t be surprised if this turns out to be the next up-and-coming neighborhood in Paris.",2019-08-21T13:27:56Z,4
29625339,254150046,Hannah,"Léa’s place was fantastic to stay in! It is a lovely and decently spacious apartment, that is 15 min walk from Gare du Nort with two local metro stations within 2 min walking distance of the home. 

The neighbourhood is lovely during the day and peaceful at night, but is also home to some great bars and places to eat!

Lejligheden ligger i et mere udsat område af byen, men vi (to kvinder) oplevede det som trygt. Derudover var det lidt svært at komme ind i lejligheden, da instruktionerne var lidt uklare, men vi kom i kontakt med Léa med det samme vi ringede, hvorefter hun hjalp os med nærmere instruktioner.

5323999,1376819,Lonnie,"My husband and I stayed for 10 nights while in Paris on vacation. We picked this apartment because it looked simple and nice and was in a great location. Here's what we liked: Lea's apartment is very well located.  It's an easy walk to anywhere you want to go. There are at least two Metro stops around the corner. The Seine is a 15-minute walk. Restaurants, museums, nightlife right downstairs. The apartment is clean; the kitchen has everything you need. Here's what we didn't like (especially given that we stayed for so long): the apartment is tiny, which is probably normal for Paris. It was just a bit shocking when we first entered it. With two suitcases and two tall people, there's not much other room. The couch in the photo is a tiny love seat which barely fits two tall people. You can't have two people in the bathroom at the same time and you can barely move your arms in the shower -- you definitely can't turn. The bed is rather uncomfortable; I could feel the springs of the mattress poking out. Also, the windows of the apartment face an alley that is very loud at night, particularly on the weekends. If you're there during the weekend and want to sleep at night, forget it. If you're there for a couple of nights and are going to party all night, this is a good place for you.",2015-10-25T12:12:31Z,3

5323999,25696228,Álvaro,"Léa is a great host. She cared for every single detail: Left us a big note explaning everything about the property and with great advice, she left everything ready for us and made us feel at home since the first minute.

The place is great. Quite big for Paris standards and really really comfortable. You feel at home. Great decoration, the place has a personalit of its own. The bed is very big and comfortable and the bathroom even if small is very clean and perfect to use.

Location cannot be better, you can walk everywhere, really close to Louvre Museum and its sorroundings, you can go for dinner or going out to Les Marais also walking, in no time you are walking in Notre Dame ... great location.

In summary, I totally recomend staying at Léa's. Great place, great host and great location.",2015-03-23T14:46:17Z,5

9360605,6819573,Lee,"Charles was a magnificent host.  He responded very quickly to all my questions and was very flexible in accommodating our unsociable arrival time.

The apartment is quite large and simply, but tastefully decorated - I loved the mix of industrial, modern & glamorous pieces.

It was clean, and surprisingly quiet given it's central location and proximity to a number of stations.  Lots of places to eat & drink the area (some quaint finds to discover), great bakery and a couple of supermarkets nearby made for a very convenient stay.

I'd suggest investing in another curtain / blind at the front of the apartment, it has quite a sunny aspect and anyone opposite would have a great view into the apartment after dark! 

All in all, i loved this apartment, its location and a terrific host.

Highly recommended. :)",2015-12-02T02:11:06Z,5

We also had the chance to use the baby bed and an extra mattress for the kids. The apartment is more than big/excellent compared to other opportunities in Paris for that value.
The area is ok (close to Le Marais which is very nice), but to reach the main attractions and Seine you must take public transport or have a long walk. :)

14940650,15870852,Najah,The apartment was great. Super Parisian and very cute. However make sure you do your research on the 18th district before you book your stay here. It was very cultural and lots of African and Middle Eastern stores. Also pretty far from the touristy stuff but the Gare du Nord station was a 15 min walk. I ubered everywhere at night but during the day time it's safe to walk around. ,2016-10-23T08:57:23Z,3

The apartment itself was clean, welcoming and very comfortable. Everything you need in a Parisian apartment. The building in which it is located felt quite secure, and was quiet which is an unfortunate contrast to the neighbourhood and street in which it is located. 
Unfortunately, we did not feel safe in the area. We witnessed crime - theft from stalls and an assault - and were pick pocketed on our second last day there. The apartment itself is great, but the journey from the metro station to the building was never a pleasant experience. I am sad to write this as if the apartment were in a different area I would recommend it to anyone, Patrice was wonderful and it is close to transport which made commuting Paris so simple. Unfortunately, because of the hawker style stalls, crime and general sense of unease in the area I cannot recommend the apartment to anyone who might be concerned about these things.",2019-06-01T14:31:17Z,4

Il nous a gentiment permis d'utiliser son ampli, et platine vinyle; un régal!  L'espace disposait du wifi, était propre et lumineux; un vrai petit nid pour un week end. Je recommande fortement donc!

L'appartement est très bien situé, à proximité de plusieurs commerces, barres et restaurants (pratique pour prendre un verre et manger...). La gare de Lyon est aussi à proximité.
 
Sur la propreté il n'y a rien a redire, tout était nickel. On avait accès a presque à tout dans l'appart. 

Je recommande sans hésiter!!! 

Merci pour tous Mathias :)

27817752,52767968,Derek,I had a wonderful time staying at Juliette's place. Great location and a beautiful flat perfect for one or two travelers. Juliette was communicative and easy to reach. I was sad to leave.,2018-08-29T12:58:35Z,5
27817752,10315837,Carol,"Juliette told us to be there before 3pm as she has other engagements so we rushed to the place (by taking an expensive Uber) from the train terminal but end up waiting by the street for more than an hour under hot sun. During that one hour we couldn't reach Juliette on the phone at all (no pick-up) so it was quite worrying and we weren't sure what to do, we had our luggage with us so we couldn't go anywhere either. When Juliette finally got back to us she mentioned she had some trouble and asked us to wait for a further few hours with several more delays. She originally suggested that we wait a few hours then take an Uber to collect the keys from another location from someone else but we suggested that we will wait nearby. At that point Juliette wasn't too helpful as she also complained about our arrival time - despite what was agreed beforehand. The few hours waiting was very stressful as Juliette wasn't responsive and it was my first time in Paris, everything was quite foreign to me. We also missed our tour which we originally planned for that afternoon and sat in a nearby restaurant waiting for hours. The restaurant owner didn't seem happy with us too as our luggage were in the way in the tiny restaurant space. Juliette did apologise at the end and agreed to reimburse our salad (from the restaurant) as compensation for the long wait but I haven't received any news/reimbursement on this until now.

About the apartment - be prepared to climb five levels of narrow and winding stairs to the top floor (no elevators and dimly-lit). I couldn't get my luggage up on my own (without risking injury) and grateful that I'm traveling with a friend so we took turn to help each other out - took us at least 20 mins+ and lots of hard work to get our luggage up (and down). Host wasn't there to help, Juliette's sister turned up to pass us the keys (after the long wait) and left immediately after.

Upon arriving in the house, the bed wasn't made and we had a sight of the yellowish mattress and pillows. We had to make our own bed and Juliette wanted guests to remove the pillow covers, bed sheet and quilt cover before leaving - so make sure to budget some time for this in your travel schedule.

Apart from everything the apartment is stylish (with Parisian features, small balcony and nice lighting) and it is in a trendy area of Paris - Voltaire, near to the Metro Station.",2018-09-17T13:06:00Z,3

3391316,13089042,Alma,"The communication with Nicolas was very easy, he gave a detailed description of how to get to the apartment in advance, he was willing to help us very quickly if we needed anything.
Me and my boyfriend liked the studio apartment very much, it was cosy and nice. The space is small, but you don't need any more space, if you stay in Paris just for a few days anyway. The bed was comfy and we could get a good rest, that was a big plus, considering that we were quite tired at the end of the day after all those long walks around the city.
The location of the studio is very good, there are a lot of boulangeries and cafes in this area. I loved staying at Montmartre, it's very pretty!
I would definitely recommend this listing!",2014-11-25T10:58:29Z,4

The flat was cosy, in a beautiful location and well placed in Montmatre and for travelling around Paris. Also this was practically the only place I came across on airbnb with a proper bed as opposed to a sofa-bed. 
100% recommend Nicolas and the flat to any airbnbers - we had a super time!    ",2014-11-15T11:13:23Z,5

I really appreciated the elegant forniture and also the  relaxing colours of the room. There is no wardrobe but if you spend just few days in Paris it's not a problem.
The place is perfect for visiting Paris: metro Abbesses and its beautiful square are just few steps away and by metro you can get where you want. 
In rue Des Abbesses,  near the studio, we  enjoyed many boulangeries for our breakfast before starting our long walks around the town.
Rue Berthe,  where the studio is located, is really near Sacre Couer, but is very silent at night. There are many bistrots and caves near you but you can sleep without any problems!
Communicating with Nicolas was easy and he was very friendly and helpful. It was a positive experience.

The room was as discribed und we liked it very much. It is furnished with elegance and style, has everything you need for a couple of days in Paris and the neighbourhood is also nice.

In general, even if it's an Airbnb, I think the house is too fool of personal stuff, making difficult to move inside.

Unit is small but fine for a few nights stay and in quiet area. As stairwell is above bedroom you can hear people walking up and down them very clearly which woke us up. 
Kitchen was clean and well equipped. There was an odor to the apartment- ?smoking so we had the windows opened frequently which aired it out but on entering apartment it was noticeable despite been aired at all times when we were there. The shower drain was clogged with hair so didnt drain well at all. On arrival our towels were also wet. I messaged host but the response was the cleaner was meant to dry them.

Everything, including cleaning supplies, all the usual things you would expect, Nespresso coffee maker and coffee, plus the things we might forget to bring, such as an umbrella,  everything I could think I might need was there.

We had an issue with the check-in, where the representative forgot to tell us that there was a code to the apartment gate, which was a real scare when we came back from dinner the first night. Luckily a resident at the apartment gave it to us, and we were able to get back inside. There was also some very loud construction happening in the flat next to ours, which I'm sure was a temporary issue (and out of the host's control), but definitely impacted our stay. Other than these issues though, it was a great apartment!",2019-05-21T13:28:21Z,3

Although you can shut the windows to tune out the noise, we loved hearing the kids screaming on their way to school and watching their parents come pick them up in the afternoon. There is a wonderful butcher just down the street and a great baker. Although we were too busy to eat in the restaurants they were full in the evenings when we came home from a long day of sightseeing and meeting up with friends and old acquaintances.

The apartment is exactly how it looks like on photos and located in the great area in a walkable distance to the main attractions of Paris. The host (Nicolas) was quite responsive and always replied to the messages within couple of hours (though we haven't really communicated a lot, just before check in and check out time). Check in was easy and fast,  Georgina met us for check in and provided all instructions. The apartment was relatively clean, though some smell was coming from the dishwasher (there were also some old stains inside), and there was quite big mold on the cieling in the bathroom, but we decided not to disturb the host with this and tried to remove mold ourselves but it came back again after a few days.

The flat was clean and had all I required to stay there for one month. The living room includes a comfy sofa-bed, and even though the living room is a bit small it is comfortable enough to have dinner or watch a movie. The kitchen is complete: big fridge, freezer, oven, microwave, stove and dishwasher. Toilet and bathroom are good enough, and the bedroom is very quiet as the window doesn’t face the street. A small thing to improve: wifi connectivity is good in the living room but poor in the bedroom, a different router or a signal extender might help.",2022-09-01T14:55:19Z,5

The house is well equipped with all you might need as it is Lea's home, so don't be surprised to find some foto or personal items among the shelter where you're looking for some oil!
The only thing that might bother you (but it did not bother us at all) is the shower that is small and needs you to sit down and hold with one hand the shower head while taking it as there is no way to hang it above you without turning the bedroom in a lake :)

The apartment is located just next to Port Royal and Jardin du Luxembourg. The little garden gives on the back of the Val de Grace Military hospital, it is adorable and pleasant. The apartment is very calm and full of natural light. The third party used to for checking is very nice and efficient. 
The wifi connection works great for a remote worker. The kitchen has everything you need. 
This is real Airbnb as you are in what seems to be a doctor's office / home. 

(-) could be better
The bed is very uncomfortable for a place of that standing, it is closer to a Sofa than a real bed.
The street where the apartment is located is closed after a massive gas explosion that damaged the whole neighborhood. You cannot go through the street as police still lock it day and night. You can't access with a cab or Uber either. 
The host should be more transparent about this, as some guests might feel unsafe and should not be left in the lurch.",2023-07-21T12:14:06Z,4

The apartment is roomy and filled with light. Its cute garden backs onto the Val de Grace hospital. Despite being on a pretty busy street, the apartment is super quiet and secluded. It was a little bit complicated to get the key from the hosting company (involved retrieving and dropping key off at two separate laundromats) but the company was very helpful and made the key exchange easier by sending someone to pick up key.

The location of the apartment was perfect - a vibrant while still quiet neighborhood with plenty of great restaurants, bars, and a food market nearby. Several attractions like the Centre Pompidou were in a walking distance, and a short 5 minute walk to the metro made it easy to get around the city.

The apartment is situated very close to Sacré Cœur and it is stunning to see this beautiful church every day on your way ""home"". And even though the neighbourhood is quite lively, the apartment is very quiet because it is placed a few meters away from the street. 

Adélaïde was very nice and easy to communicate with. She really did all she could to feel us welcome - and she succeeded!  :)

From the first email, Adélaïde was warm and welcoming. She and her partner met us at the apartment and they were very helpful and friendly, yet respectful of the fact that we only had a short time in Paris! Her place is even more beautiful than in the pictures. It is very comfortable, with different spaces to spread out in (not all confined in one “room”) and it has been decorated in an absolutely charming, original manner – I wish my place at home looked more like Adélaïde’s! The rain shower is incredible – it’s worth renting this place just for the shower! Comfortable bed, great internet, inspiring decorative touches. It’s only one short flight of stairs up, and the windows open onto a quiet courtyard. The apartment is perfectly nestled in a quiet, safe neighbourhood between the Butte Montmartre and walking access to the metro. At the end of the block the stairs take you right up to Sacré Coeur; we loved the fact that we could wander through Montmartre late into the evening, and then our apartment was just steps away. There is a café and an excellent bakery nearby. The # 4 metro, which is only a 5 minute walk away, is a key line for accessing the major attractions of Paris and is also the one you need for the Gare du Nord and the airport. This was our first AirBnB experience, and it makes us want to never stay in a hotel again. Thank-you, Adélaïde and Rodrigo!",2015-05-16T15:58:15Z,5

Adélaïde hat uns trotz kleiner Verspätung (Paris hatte Stau) super nett empfangen und uns alles Nötige in Ihrem Apartment erklärt. Auch die Übergabe am Ende war super freundlich und unkompliziert. Die Wohnung (39m²) ist für Pariser Verhältnisse ausreichend groß, sehr geschmackvoll eingerichtet und überaus gemütlich. Alle wichtigen Dinge zum Leben waren vorhanden.

15473721,74894195,Yelianne,Such a great place to stay that I had to book again for a second time ! Alexandre was very flexible with my check in time and easy to communicate with during my stay . His mother was very sweet and helpful . Highly recommend to anyone looking to stay in Paris . It's the perfect location !!  ,2016-10-22T08:02:36Z,5
15473721,74894195,Yelianne,Absolutely loved the location of Alexandre's flat . Close to many restaurants and shops in the Latin quarters of Paris . Just a 5 minute walk to the notre dame and less than a 2 minute walk to two separate metro stations . I was welcomed by Alexandre's mother Sophie who was very helpful and attentive as well as kind. Definitely highly recommend this air bnb to everyone ,2016-10-21T08:54:24Z,5
15473721,3345726,Frode,"Alexandres apartment is a perfect respite in busy Paris. The location is fantastic, both when getting to/from the airport but also to get around Paris. Subway and RER trains, as well as buses, are 2-4 minutes walk away, and you're literally steps away from major sights like the Notre Dame.

We arrived at a slightly unfortunate time and neither Alexandre or his mom were there to meet us. Still, Alexandre arranged for the concierge of the apartment building to welcome us and show us around. Even though she did not speak much English, she was a joy to meet and she very much made us feel welcome (my knowledge of French helped). Alexandre himself was also very communicative around our arrival to make sure we got to the apartment safely.

The apartment itself makes very good use of the small space. It has a fully functioning kitchen with a nice bar that we made good use of for both breakfast and relaxing at the end of the day. We appreciated the actual bed (as opposed to a fold out etc.), although it was on the firmer side, and the bathroom was very nice.

During our stay Alexandre's mom made it a point to stop by and ask how we were doing. This really shows how Alexandre and his mom cares for their guests, and it is indeed genuin. Her homemade evening treat made us feel very welcome and special.

All in all, Alexandres apartment is a terrific base for your ventures in Paris and we would definitely stay here again on our next trip.",2017-07-16T11:26:21Z,5
15473721,10737736,Alshaba,"Alexandres place is located at such a prime location. The host was super helpful and made sure all our needs were met! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and found it close to all major things (eg public transport, night life, restarauts, etc). The host went above and beyond to offer help. We are very happy with our stay! ",2017-06-11T11:54:43Z,5
15473721,51097744,John,"Beautiful, cozy and very comfortable apartment. Perfectly equipped and furnished, with taste and quality, not to mention a welcoming bottle of wine. The location could not be better, literally a few steps from Notre Dame. Despite its central location, the apartment is very quiet. Excellent and extremely friendly reception and advice on the best places to eat and shop from Alexander´s mother made me immediately feel at home in Paris. My best Airbnb stay so far. Thanks!",2017-06-01T14:42:58Z,5
15473721,67824307,Gale,"I had the most tremendous stay at Alexandre's apartment. While it is true the space is quite compact, it is also beautifully finished and I found was just the right size for the independent traveller. There's an espresso machine in the apartment (which saved me plenty of euro every day), the light is lovely, and it is a very quick walk to Shakespeare and Company - a large part of why I was back in Paris.  Do note that there is a private toilet separate from the apartment, so you must enter and exit the apartment with your keys in order to use the facilities (which I never found to be an issue). There is also an elevator up a small flight of stairs so you don't have to carry your luggage to the top of the building, but would not be accessible for those in a wheelchair or with very limited mobility. When I fell ill with bronchitis, Alexandre's family even brought me soup, some home remedies, and shared some extra chocolate cake they had when I was feeling better. He is very communicative and prompt in his responses to set up bookings or when I had trouble with the wifi - I quickly felt very at home in the space. I would absolutely stay here again!",2016-11-09T09:53:11Z,5

15473721,128183590,Marina,"L'appartement est dans le meilleur emplacement qu'un étranger peut rester à Paris. Même de l'aéroport quelqu’un arrive en train (RER) directement sans changement. Tout est à proximité (metro, super marche, bistro, magasins, cinema …), le quartier est toujours en vie! L'appartement est petit, parfait pour une personne, mais il peut aussi accueillir deux personnes. Le lit pourrait être un peu plus large. La cuisine est très bien. L'entrée des toilettes est en dehors de l'appartement, mais ca il est moins un problème que ce qu'il ressemble au premier abord. La communication etait avec la mère d'Alexandre, et etait excellente !! Sophie est spécifique, précise et généreuse (elle a laissé a l'appartement des bonbons incroyables qu'elle a fait pour nous). En résumé, on peut dire que l'appartement offre un logement d’ un niveau très bon par rapport au prix que nous avons payé!

Absolutely beautiful. If there’s even a tiny percentage of an artist within you than you’ll very much appreciate the space.
Fantastic location, close to pretty much everywhere. 
To get to the flat you need to walk up the stairs and then again up to the 4th floor (at least you’ll get fit in no time).
Remember to bring your hairdryer, it’s mentioned in the description but I missed it. Although you can use the fan if you desperate 🤣
If this place will be available next time I’m in Paris, I’m definitely booking it again!

28149155,71549657,Andi,Joris’ place was my favorite place I stayed in during my whole Europe trip. It’s absolutely beautiful. The decor is to die for and the location couldn’t have been better. We were close enough to walk to most things we wanted to do but far away enough to avoid a lot of the noise and foot traffic of central Paris. A truly lovely Paris experience.,2019-12-10T12:45:33Z,5
28149155,8069855,Sunny,This place is a gem! I’ve stayed at Airbnb’s before in Paris and usually they’re smaller than they look in the photo. The apartment is really spacious and airy. The host is really quick with responding and attentive. The location is perfect. It’s great for sightseeing as well as just for people watching. It’s very central and hip. And besides being perfect on its own. You can’t ask for a better price for the value. It’s quite the steal. Thanks again for the wonderful stay! Ps it leaves you inspired to go home and decorate.,2019-09-23T11:14:40Z,5

3716928,10240134,Shannon,"Amazing place! The flat is located on the fifth floor, which is tough with a ton of luggage, but totally worth it once you enter. It's stylishly decorated with everything you need to feel like a true Parisian :) the bed is located in the 'loft' - just take a little ladder up to it. I loved all the organic soaps in the kitchen and bathroom. We felt right at home. The flat is located in a great area - upscale shops and delicious restaurants. Check out a falafel place! It was very easy to coordinate with Claire. She was super helpful and accommodating. Would have loved to stay longer. Great place - would highly recommend. ",2015-07-17T11:48:53Z,5
3716928,1722507,Carly,"Claire and Peter were very accommodating hosts. They worked with me on my late arrival time without any complaints and were very communicative with me before my stay. They graciously provided me with all the metro information I needed, as well as food and sightseeing suggestions.

The apartment was clean and cozy and the location was beyond-ideal—right next to the Picasso museum, open air markets, great shopping and the most delicious falafel I've ever had. I was very happy to have Claire and Peter's place as my base camp for my adventures in Paris. I felt like I was part of the neighborhood; there's nothing touristy or gimmicky about it. I'd come back in heartbeat!",2015-07-16T12:01:28Z,5
3716928,5260023,Tamara,"Claire was an amazing host and made our stay very enjoyable. Although we did not meet Claire in person, she had everything planned out from our arrival to our departure. 

The flat was incredible, situated in the historic Le Marais district. Boutiques, restaurants, coffee shops, art galleries are right outside the front door. I felt very much at home here and would recommend this flat to anyone looking to experience what Parisian living is like. 

Thank you for hosting us Claire!

It was safe, quiet and clean and not touristy at all which is something that was important to us. The apartment itself was beautiful in a classic building- very clean, stylish and there were nice little touches throughout. Claire and Peter made us feel very welcome, they were easily contactable at all times and even had a thoughtful guide to the area which came is very handy! Although we didn't meet them their brother was waiting for us on arrival and they were very accommodating in regards to arrival/departure times. All in all our time in Paris was wonderful and this was largely down to where we were staying - by the end we felt very at home and didn't want to leave! Thank you very much for having us stay!

3716928,32551263,Ludivine,"Great stay at Claire and Peter's ! We spent 2 nights there and everything worked very well. 

The apartment has just the perfect size for 2 people and everything is well refitted. It's location is absolutely perfect in the Marais area, close to supermarkets, restaurants, café, cute little shops, subway stations and sights. Plus, it is decorated tastefully ! However, you will have to be fit to reach this little gem as it is located on the 5th floor without a lift. Be prepared to muscle your legs :)

We didn't have the chance to meet Claire and Peter during our stay but we exchanged some mails and texts with them and everything was clearly explained and we always got quick answers to our questions. We also received a mail from Claire with instructions and useful things to know 1 day before our arrival. Very good idea !

We really appreciated to leave our big backpacks in the apartment while finishing to visit Paris as our train was at 5pm. 

We recommend that place without any hesitation !",2015-09-03T11:25:42Z,5

Claire and Peter's apartment is a Gem, we felt at home the minute we walked through the door. It is very appointed with a great couch and a Nespresso machine. Although small, like all places in the center of Paris, it feels airy and spacious.
Claire and Peter were very helpful from the first contact. Peter met us as we arrived giving us helpful tips for our stay and a broad smile.
The Marais is a busy, bustling area with endless things to do! It is in the very heart of Paris and from there we mostly got around on foot. There are also Metro stations close by.
Thank you!",2015-06-14T14:48:07Z,5
3716928,33718641,Bhavin,"Summary:  Lovely flat, a couple of MINOR inconveniences, great location for food places and exploring Le Marais, short-to-medium walk to a few tube lines.  RECOMMENDED!

Great things:

- Lovely flat with lots of cooking ingredients, books, accessories (e.g. gloves, umbrella etc), toiletries (shower gel, toilet paper etc),

- Didn't get to meet the hosts as they were out of the country, but they made an effort to write things down for us in detail beforehand and also left detailed notes inside the flat, as well as maps.

- Some lovely food places very nearby in all directions!  One especially good one (so we've heard) right next door to the flat itself!

- A short-to-moderate (7-8min) walk to many metro stations on varying lines.

- Great location to explore Le Marais.  A ""Velib"" (Paris bike rental) station a minute's walk away.  


Inconveniences / Improvements:

- Noting that we couldn't meet the hosts as they were out of the country.... We didn't know we needed a code for the bottom door as we weren't given one.  We were VERY lucky that someone came into the column of flats at the very same time we arrived that let us in and told us the code.  

- When we came in, there was a patch on the carpet on the bed's level that was wet, probably because the roof window had been left open (for our comfort) and it had rained before we got there.  

- The lock on the main door was a little difficult to work out and get right, but after a little struggle and experimentation, we got used to it.  

-  We couldn't get the lock on the bathroom door to work (although admittedly we didn't try very hard).


OVERALL:  Recommended :)",2015-06-03T14:53:33Z,4

L'appartement est très agréable, propre, bien situé, aménagé avec goût, et Mathieu nous avait laissé en évidence tout le nécessaire à notre petit séjour.  Il n'a pu être présent pour nous accueillir mais s'est débrouillé pour trouver une solution simple pour que nous récupérions les clés et s'est montré très réactif et agréable au cours de nos échanges.  
Un grand merci à lui, nous vous le recommandons. :)",2018-10-01T14:52:28Z,5
29108950,110199555,Amanda,"Jeremy was a great host and provided us with a warm welcome and was very accommodating. Jeremy’s Place was very minimalist with only the bare necessities available to guests. I took off one star for a couple of reasons- the bathroom door does not close all the way so privacy was an issue for us. Also the photos showed a television in the bedroom that was not there for our visit. There were a few small things that could have improved the stay, but overall a great experience in a very quaint and lovely part of Paris.",2019-09-24T13:12:14Z,4

29108950,17156273,Emma,"Highly recommended staying at Jérémy’s place not only for being a great host but also for a fantastic location. The metro line is literally a 3 minute walk away and other lines are easily accessible from there as well. 

Jérémy’s flat is simple and minimalist but suited us perfectly. We stayed for 4 nights and found the Parisian flat more than delightful and airy. There is a mini (2 ring) hob but not an oven, so for longer stays (4+ nights) it’s worth knowing as it made us eat out more (not always a bad thing), but we would have certainly liked to cook a nice meal one evening but it was limited. 

The flat is located on a 3rd floor which is accessed by stairs alone but this is more than manageable and wasn’t an inconvenience. 

The flat itself is located on a little side road with minimal noise disruption. The flat has a small courtyard behind a locked door to the street which we really loved, and made the flat seem even more secluded and intimate. 

Overall would highly recommend!",2019-09-14T12:58:22Z,5

He left us a very clean house and even put a fan for us as it was so unexpectedly hot in Paris. He allowed us to have a very late check in and also a late checkout with no additional cost. It is very recommended if you are a couple or very close friends as the house is tiny (Parisienne style) and the bathroom door cannot be locked, so intimacy is recommended ;). Really great host and charming neighbourhood and location!",2019-07-01T12:08:33Z,5

29108950,17876388,Timur,"Мы в супругой останавливались в апартаментах Jérémy на 6 дней. Впечатления самые восхитительные. 
Во-первых - прекрасное расположение. Это действительно самый центр Монмартра. До метро Abbesses - 3 минуты пешком (нужно только обойти два дома). В 30 метрах от выхода из дома расположена овощная лавка из фильма «Амели», в 400 метрах от дома - знаменитая смотровая площадка у Базилики Санкре-Кёр, с которой весь Париж виден как на ладони. Совсем рядом множество кафе, пекарен, маленьких магазинчиков.
Во-вторых, очень тихо. Окна выходят во двор, соседи тоже очень тихие (мы их ни разу не слышали). Поэтому получалось отлично выспаться после прогулок по Парижу.
В третьих, апартаменты очень чистые. Видно, что ремонт сдала совсем недавно, новая сантехника, в мини-кухне есть посуда, плита, тостер, холодильник -  всё для того, чтобы покушать дома, если не успели зайти в кафе.
Jérémy  - замечательный, заботливый, вежливый хозяин: в установленной время время встретил, проводил нас, помог донести багаж, дал полезные советы, всегда был на связи.
Будем рады остановиться здесь в следущий раз и будем рекомендовать эти апартаменты своим друзьям.",2019-10-10T12:11:43Z,5

The apartment is really clean and nice , I was really happy that it’s on 1st floor so I didn’t have to walk upstairs each time . Also the subway is literally 30 sec away . It’s not too hot in summer because it’s first floor so I was really exited when it was 40 + outside . Also there is everything  at the apartment - micro wave, washing machine etc , which is awesome . It was an amazing stay!! Xxx",2019-07-09T12:23:30Z,5

It is in a big city of course, but I found it's fine to sleep and concentrate for work. The neighborhood is amazing - short walk to beautiful Buttes Charmont, and to the canal, as well as just 7min metro to Gare Du Nord.

What really stood out, however, was Carine's helpfulness and thoughtfulness towards any questions or concerns we had during our stay. It's always a pleasure to stay at an Airbnb where the host goes above and beyond to ensure a comfortable and enjoyable stay.

The location of the apartment in the 19th arrondissement was also a highlight of our stay. The area is very vibrant and full of hidden gems to explore, which made for a truly authentic Parisian experience.

Overall, I would highly recommend this Airbnb apartment to anyone looking for a cozy, very well located, and well-organized place to stay in Paris.",2023-04-13T11:23:18Z,5
35563732,402361966,Joudy,"It was my first time at Carine's place, and definitely not the last one.
The host would welcome you with her generous smile, with all instructions you need about heating, water, the gate opening, etc. well mentioned and written down.
The location is strategic: on the very bottom of the building you have the Ourcq metro station. The neighborhood is calm yet full of whatever you need: cafe, restaurants, pharmacy, monoprix...
I particularly enjoyed a morning walk with my husband to the Mont Butte Chaumon, an exceptional Park in Paris which looks like on a hilltop.
Carine's home is very cosy, ideal space for two persons. The wifi is fast. I personally enjoyed a lot of details in the decoration and the books that reflects a genuinely spiritual person.

Light and love to Carine 🌻💗

The neighbourhood is vibrant and fun to explore, close to a lot of shops and restaurants, as well as an amazing park nearby.
Apartment itself was clean and equipped with everything we needed for a short stay. Carine has unique and tasteful furniture, not to mention her very cute set of tiny collectible items from where she had travelled, which makes the apartment feel a bit personal but also very interesting.
Carine greeted us when we arrived and was always reachable if we need anything. She even let us leave our luggage there on the last day. Overall we really enjoyed staying at Carine's. It was a very nice Parisian experience and we would surely do it again.",2019-09-21T12:39:06Z,5

The place is located close to both metro Bibliotheque F. Mitterand (need to change one RER to and from both airport and Gare du Nord so easily accessible when arriving by air and train, although do mind that the Saint Michel - Notre Dame station does not have escalators or lifts between the platforms of RER B and C) and metro Olympiades. There are places to dine out in the vicinity, including one of the Asian areas of the city. Some of the institutions such as INALCO are in walking distance, with makes it ideal for temporary students, visitors and researchers. The studio is on the 9th floor with a nice view. There is an enclosed inner garden on the ground floor of the building. The access to the building and the studio is safe and secure. The surroundings are generally quiet and peaceful. The room may get hot in summer during the daytime but the window can be opened and the shutters can be closed. At night, a cool breeze usually cools down the room, however, a standing fan has also been provided.

I toured the Musee d'Orsay (the museum in the old train station , it can be seen from the flat window across Tuileries Garden) to pass the time before I could get into the flat. Once checked in to the flat there were snacks and a bottle of wine waiting. The flat is very centrally located.

The apartment was extremely clean and exactly as described. Across the street from the Louvre and just about every major site is walkable! If walking is not your thing there are many public transport options close by or ubers/taxis in abundance. Street can be a little noisy during peak hours but with windows closed you can barely hear anything. There is A/C available but thankfully we didn't have to use. Small and functional kitchenette stocked with tea and coffee, utensils,  etc. is also a bonus. Elevator in building so no need to worry about stairs...Perfect place for 2 people. Book it and you won't regret it!",2017-10-01T13:37:26Z,5

1696940,26054468,Jennifer And Brandi,"Olimpia is an incredible host. From the minute I made contact considering the rental, her communication has been prompt, detailed and filled with insider tips about the wonderful city of Paris. Her apartment is clean, very centrally located with a view that's unreal. Her apartment was my home away from home for 9 days, which made the entire trip so enjoyable. I even met her at her own unit on the same floor where she showed me the magical view of the city at night. I am so lucky to have found this place to call home for my trip.",2017-08-27T13:01:27Z,5
1696940,84141160,Joseph,Olimpia is a really classy lady with real style.  She goes the extra mile to make you comfortable and feel cared for.  She went so far as to pick up some packages I had sent from the States.  When I lost the keys she was very understanding and it was all handled very professionally.  She is great and the location across from the Louvre and the Park is fantastic for tourists.,2017-08-09T12:26:01Z,4
1696940,57814243,Alanna,Olimpia's studio was the perfect place for my fiance and I. She was very accomodating and kind. The apartment building is a short walk to the louvre and various cafes and shops. Olimpia was kind enough to ensure we had a full tour of her historic apartment and the spectacular views.,2017-08-04T07:44:18Z,5
1696940,123775019,Kimberlee,"This place is the PERFECT location and Olimpia provided excellent communication, warm hospitality and very easy check in and check out. We highly highly highly recommend this apartment!!",2017-07-26T09:57:47Z,5
1696940,130268673,Jason,"Olimpia's place is in a great location with a great view. At first it seems small, but I've come to realize this is typical of Paris apartments. She did not misrepresent its size or anything in my opinion. She was very welcoming, gracious, kind, and professional. On our last night we noticed a leak from the shower. I notified her and informed her I was stepping out and I didn't mind if someone repaired it while we were out. She had someone repair it almost immediately and when I returned there was no sign anyone had entered (besides the fast repair). It should be noted that the washer and dryer are not located in the unit but that is not a problem. There are 2 locked doors to enter the apartment and I placed my laundry in a bag between the doors at her suggestion. When I returned they were in the same spot washed, dried and neatly folded. Thank you Olimpia :)",2017-07-22T11:22:28Z,5
1696940,101237598,Renee,"The location of this apartment is Amazing!  We had read all the great reviews before we booked the place, but, being unfamiliar with the layout of Paris, we still weren't prepared for what a great location this is.  It is directly on the Rue de Rivoli, which is right next to the Sein River (just across the Tullieries gardens), and the apartment is right next to the Louvre.  And the Metro line is literally about 100 feet from the apartment.  There are tons of restaurants and shops in the streets below the apartment.

And I can't say enough good things about Olimpia and Patrik (her freind who was there to check out out and help us get our taxi on the last morning).  Olimpia always answered my text messages and calls promptly, and she showed us the view from her apartment (just across the hallway from the rented apartment) both when we first got there and then again at night.  The view from her apartment is amazing and you are literally looking at the Tullieries gardens, the Louvre, and the Eiffel Tower.  

The apartment itself if very comfortable.  At first it seemed small based on American standards, but as we got settled in, we realized that it was plenty big enough for us.  There is a comfortable bed, sufficient closet space, a nice bathroom, and a small kitchenette.  Although we didn't cook any real meals, the kitchenette was great for keeping drinks cold, making coffee and tea (supplied by Olimpia) and making breakfast (usually bagettes and cheese/ham etc. from the corner store, just a block away.  Olimpia also provides a hair dryer and an iron and ironing board, so you don't need to bring those.  ",2017-07-11T09:06:22Z,5
1696940,110525821,Maria,Our stay at Olimpia 's place was great!! The studio is in a perfect location next to the louvre and has a metro station right acros the street! Olimpia was a wonderful host! Very accommodating and responsive to all messages! We had a delay with our plane and she accommodated our later arrival! She greeted us when we arrived and had snacks and a bottle of wine waiting in the studio! She even welcomed us into her apartment early in the morning before our flight home to take pictures of the beautiful view of the louvre and of the city! Overall we had a lovely experience not only in Paris but staying at Olimpia's place! ,2017-07-02T13:47:08Z,5
1696940,2111735,Jesse,"We had a fantastic stay at Olimpia's very comfortable, well-located apartment. She was a perfect host: very welcoming, hospitable, and available whenever we needed anything. It was an incredible opportunity to stay right in the heart of Paris--we could get everywhere we needed to go very easily from her place--but the apartment was also amazingly quiet at night thanks to double-paned windows. Great view, nice space, and an air conditioner that came in handy on a hot week in the city. Highly recommended--a great value! ",2017-06-14T06:52:55Z,5

It is in the best neighborhood, the view is spectacular, the home is historic, and the host is fantastically warm and helpful.  The studio is quiet and has what is needed for a wonderful stay in Paris.  If you want to be in the center of it all then this is your place.  Olimpia had a bottle of wine and snacks for us when we arrived, she told us about the history of the apartment and had given us lots of information about the neighborhood.  It is so near to the Louvre!  Loved our stay and our charming host.  Hope to visit again soon!",2017-03-25T08:09:09Z,5
1696940,16323932,Carol,"We loved our stay at Olimpia's place.  Her friend Gabriela is so kind and meet us when we arrived.  She told us everything we needed to know about the place,  area and getting around Paris which was so helpful as it was our first time there. 
Olimpia's place is warm and cozy.  It's very well equipped with everything you would need for your stay.  It's right in the heart of Paris and we were able to walk most places.  Lots of food and shopping options in the area.  We meet Olimpia on our last night and she shared her amazing view of Paris at night.  Check in and out was very easy.  
Can't wait for a return visit!  ",2017-03-21T10:26:25Z,5
1696940,69554036,Elise,"We loved staying at Olimpia's place. We weren't able to meet her but she had her friend Gabriela greet us and give us a tour. Gabriela was super kind and took great care of us! The apartment was clean and had all the amenities that we needed including a kitchenette stocked with coffee and tea and clean towels. The room was small but was definitely enough space for the two of us. The bathroom was a little tight for two people trying to get ready so we had to take turns. And the bed was not super comfortable but we mostly slept fine. It was very quite even though it was right next to the Louvre, except for the construction happening upstairs each morning. Luckily they didn't start doing noisy things until 9am or later but it meant we couldn't sleep in. It's a 5 min walk to the Louvre or the metro with tons of shopping and restaurants within a 5-15 minute walk. We loved our time. We'll definitely be back!",2017-03-15T10:08:20Z,5

Le quartier est plutôt calme et trés agréable, la station de métro est juste à côté. 
Ein wunderschönes Appartment in einem ruhigen Viertel nahe eines grossen Parks. Der Kontakt mit Mehdi war während der Buchung und des gesamten Aufenthalts perfekt.

5668795,31624592,Jeffrey,"We stayed for 10 days and we had a great time. The place was perfect. Very clean, lots of natural lighting, and if you need to sleep in, there are heavy shades. There was tons of 5 Star Restaurants around as well as local/ famous bar scene which was walking distance. The Metro was right across the street and if you want to Bike/lime, it was only arms distant away. We would definitely stay here again. Thanks again guys - Jeff",2018-11-06T15:38:56Z,5

Alles is er. Het lijkt buitenaf was minder, maar dat is facade. Pierre had de verhuur uitbesteed aan Nicolas, die dit vriendelijk en erg professioneel deed. Omdat je in Parijs toch niet binnen blijft, was ons verblijf puur verblijf.

When we arrived they gave us great tips on what to see an do in Paris. The apartment is located in a very quite neighbourhood, has all the facilities you need and with two subway stations nearby every part of the city is conveniently reachable. 

Only the last night we had a chance of meeting Adrien in person, he's easy going and fun to chat with, we watched half a soccer game and drank a couple of beers. Definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a place to stay in Paris.

Keep in mind that it is not in the centre, but the Batignolles district is very safe and quiet while having quite a few options to eat around the apartment. We recommend the bakery near the church close to the apartment for some great coffee and pastries. Great transit options for getting to the main attractions as well. The apartment feels very secure and there is an elevator for heavy luggage. The bathroom and kitchen are modern and updated, and there is plenty of space to cook, although we didn’t get the chance to. Thanks Ylies for a great stay!

Cuando fuimos, compartimos casa con el gato, que es el ser más adorable de la tierra, muy cariñoso, aunque con ansias de libertad (hay que tener cuidado al abrir ventanas y puertas) y muy aficionado a comer. Muy recomendable. Si volvemos a París nos gustaría repetir.",2018-02-21T13:27:20Z,5

5687285,50164901,Kara,"If you're looking to be central to a lot (3 minute walk to Notre Dame, across the street from Saint Chappelle, walking distance from the Louvre), plus near an adorable neighborhood full of shopping, plus right next door to an amazing French restaurant- then look no further. This is the best location ever! Plus, if you want to go to places that are a little further away, the metro is extremely close too. The apartment itself was great, and perfect space for the two of us. ",2017-07-20T11:50:23Z,5

Mallory's apartment was a perfect choice. Right in the heart of the ile de la cite. We lived like Parisians. In the morning I would walk to the nearest boulongerie, buy baguette and enjoy the area and fresh breeze from the Seine river. Mallory and Clara have made all their best to facilitate our stay at the place. We value that most! ",2017-05-16T13:41:13Z,5

Mallory was friendly and accommodating.  We would not hesitate to contact him again for our next trip to Paris.",2015-06-25T11:47:51Z,4

5687285,66832157,Robert,"Mallory's place was very adequate and I stayed there for a week (my wife also for 3 days). The size was good, the bed comfy and all was very clean. The noise in other reviews was not an issue for us at all. Did I mention location - can't be beat - safe and central. Mallory also was very good and quickly purchased some essential kitchen items I requested (coffee maker). He was good. Improvements to make the flat better would be a sofa (the existing one is a futon and doesn't accommodate old bodies well). A week of walking around Paris necessitates a place to relax. And a small table to eat and surf at would also greatly enhance the flat. Overall - good value! ",2017-04-27T14:39:51Z,3

5687285,45781617,Ilavarasi,My husband and I stayed in Mallory’s apartment for 5 nights in December. The best part of this unit is its location. We were surrounded by various Metro stations and lines! It made it very convenient and easy to get around Paris! The apartment itself was nice and cosy and all amenities listed in the advertisement were there and he even had a hair dryer and vacuum cleaner in the house! I was really glad I chose this unit as it was located on the first floor of a secure apartment building and could only be accessed with a number code at the entrance. Mallory was very welcoming and orientated us to the apartment and even gave us a city/metro map to facilitate our getting-around Paris. The only downside to the apartment is that there is a lot of noise when the neighbours go up and down the staircase that is located right outside Mallory’s unit. The direct neighbour was also a little noisy at night and we could hear the stomping around. That we know is definitely beyond Mallory’s control ☺ so we just dealt with it. This unit is a definite YES when it comes to picking an AirBnB in central Paris.,2015-12-14T12:04:18Z,5
5687285,42974153,Helen,We had an amazing few days in Paris. The location of Mallory's apartment is fantastic. We were able to walk to both the Louvre and Musee d'Orsay; shop and eat along the Rue de Rivoli and felt very safe in the local area. The apartment is small but no smaller than a good hotel room and has everything you could wish for and was comfortable.  Mallory was very helpful and we had no issues with communication. This was our first Airbnb experience and we are converts. I have no hesitation in recommending this accommodation. Hope we will be back one day. Thanks Mallory! ,2015-12-07T11:51:13Z,5

It is really well located - so you can easily explore areas like the Canal St. Martin, Le Marais (about a 30 - 40 minute walk away).  It is on a quiet side-street so although near nightlife you will still get a great night sleep.  On that note, the flat itself is cosy and equipped with everything that you will need for a solo or couples trip to Paris.  ",2017-06-07T14:17:33Z,4

This AirBNB exceeded those expectations with the location and the view from the apartment. After settling in, we did not have to venture more than 50 yards to encounter a wine bar, tapas restaurant (Olivier is the owner), a craft beer pub, bakery, and grocery store. Beyond these steps, there was so much to explore and easy to get around. The host was responsive to any questions. There was a lovely view from these windows down the street and when the windows were shut, there was no noise. There was another window to an interior courtyard by the bed.

22313560,21370281,Vaida,"Anne Charlotte is a very charming host, accepted us the last minute. Location is just great, neighbourhood is very cozy and close to nice restaurants, also metro station. Apartment is in a very safe closed space, nights were calm, except for one when there was a loud celebration somewhere further away in the street. Great small & charming place !",2019-08-04T12:55:21Z,5
22313560,120597059,Ellie,"We really enjoyed our stay at Anne-Charlotte’s apartment. The location is great and close to the metro station which was very appreciated after a long day of exploring Paris! 

The apartment is small, but we expected it from the pictures and it didn’t bother us as we were out most of the day anyway. 

The view of the Parisian rooftops was lovely to wake up to and we made use of the kitchen facilities to prepare breakfast and lunch everyday. Everything we needed was there! 

Definitely recommend for two people looking to be out in Paris but want somewhere homely, uniquely decorated and wonderfully located to stay when they return.",2019-06-24T12:08:41Z,4
22313560,13024158,Fiona,Anne-Charlotte was really easy to communicate with and gave great directions and information. The flat is in a great location which is very close to the train station and a metro. The flat is really cute and is wonderfully decorated. The sofa bed is unfortunately pretty uncomfortable and loud. Overall we had a nice stay at Anne- Charlotte‘s and can recommend it.,2019-06-20T11:52:16Z,4
22313560,252877381,Andrey,"Anne-Charlotte's place is undeniably the most Parisian place in Paris one could conceivably book here. The atmosphere of the flat, the view and especially the location of this booking  was phenomenal to say the least. Located 3 minutes away from the metro (if yousl stop to look around for a minute) as well as close to a neverending stream of shops, places to eat and simply gawk at, it provided me and my wife with an unforgettable honeymoon experience. Hats off.",2019-05-17T12:54:51Z,5
22313560,57773251,James,The flat was extremely well located and very easy to find. Anne-Charlotte gave perfect directions and was available to answer all of our queries. You won't find a more cosy spot for your city break.,2019-05-06T11:42:53Z,5
22313560,27194511,Sarah,The place is cosy and sweet. It has a very nice style. The communication with Anne-Charlotte was super easy and she seems to be very caring. All in all a good place to stay. Unfortunately the bed is quite uncomfortable and you can tell that the laundry is washed in a smokers place.,2019-04-28T11:07:39Z,4
22313560,86475676,Siru,"We had such an amazing stay in Anne-Charlotte's flat! It's so cute and stylish, the pictures show how it is, nothing came as a bad surprise. Anne-Charlotte is a great host, quick and friendly with messages. I'd recommend this place to my friends! But maybe if you're suffering from back issues the bed is not suitable for you other than that it's a perfect spot for a couple or two friends. :)",2019-04-23T14:36:42Z,4
22313560,102885690,Naja,"Everything went easy and smooth with check in and check out. Anne-Charlotte was very flexible and good with communication. The flat was lovely with a great view and a nice and safe backyard. Everything was perfect except the bed which was very noisy and not good if you have problems with your back.

22313560,67415055,Mark,"It's a charismatic and sweet place in a great location. It's tiny (sofa or bed, but not both) but in a cosy way. The bed is maybe a bit loud (considering the thin walls I hardly dared to turn at night). But else it's really quiet considering the central location. The host is charming to match her flat. The view out of the window is lovely. Very recommended.",2018-11-11T13:52:56Z,5
22313560,19763729,Leslie,"The place was as described and shown on the photo with a very tasty decoration. Even if it is rather small the space is well optimized and this is big enough for 2 people to sleep for few days. The flat was also very clean and the communication with Anne-Charlotte very easy and reactive. The flat is not on the street side so rather quite even if you can easily hear the neighbors (which were quite when we were there). The neighborhood is very cool with a lot of café, bars, restaurants and local shops. This very close to a metro station and even at walking distance to main Paris attractions. We recommend it for a 3 or 4 days stay in Paris. Thanks!",2018-10-29T15:21:12Z,4

5474711,1196506,John,"Guadalupe's place is in a perfect location - there is a métro stop seconds from the apartment, plus many bus lines within a 5 minute walk, which I used more than the métro to be able to see different places above ground. To qualify my response about soap, there is handsoap at the bathroom and kitchen sinks. I always travel with my own bath soap and shampoo so it's never a problem. Guadalupe was very helpful pointing out the amenities of the apartment and offering tips for local restaurants and museum exhibitions. This was by far one of the best AirBnB experiences I've ever had.  Highly recommended!!",2019-01-05T14:51:55Z,5

Guadalupe is a great host and pleasant to deal with.",2018-10-11T14:35:02Z,5
5474711,2661899,Josh,"Guadalupe's flat was the perfect spot for my wife and I on our last visit to Paris. With a prime location just steps from the Saint Maur metro stop,  you can get wherever you want quick. In this area of the 11e you are at ground zero for Paris's current eating scene and what feels like a very charming and bohemian neighborhood. The apartment has everything you need as a traveller and was spotless. The double pained windows in the bedroom provide you with complete silence for sleeping. The adjustable bed is also super comfortable and has more then enough space for two. Guadalupe was a gracious host, meeting us upon arrival and giving several great local recommendations. I highly recommend this apartment.",2018-10-04T12:12:13Z,5
5474711,32940123,Susan,"Guadalupe's 3rd floor (US) walk-up, just off the trendy rue Oberkampf, was a wonderful base for 13 nights. A rare Airbnb that doesn't scream IKEA, it has an old world charm yet is comfortably furnished. The compact kitchen is surprisingly well equipped and functional. The bathroom is a bit tight (not for those over 200 lbs!) but everything functions well, including the little washing machine (you dry clothes on a rack). The WC is separate, which is considered desirable in Paris. I was a bit hesitant to book with so few photos but they showed what you needed to know.

There's noise from a couple of bars at night, but the bedroom window is triple glazed and very quiet (open windows in summer might be an issue). Metro is half a block away, and nearby Oberkampf is a merchant street with plenty of shops and restaurants. Guadalupe was delightful and communication was excellent. I'd happily stay here again.

(19th century walk-up buildings in Paris have 6-inch high steps, so they're much easier to climb than American stairs)",2017-02-02T07:58:45Z,5

A few minutes away from the Opera district as well as the Louvre Museum, everything (from stores, to great restaurants, to supermarkets, to different convenient metro lines) is at your doorstep. Unless you're looking for a location on the left bank of Paris, I cannot think of a better location on the right bank.

The owners are charming and eager to make the experience as positive as possible. They are jovial, polite, extremely responsive and very respectful. Make no mistake, this is the place where you want to stay during your Paris vacation.",2018-01-04T14:10:43Z,5

26439588,95902294,Fiona,"Camille's apartment exudes retro chic and is a brilliant place to stay; you have everything you need both in the apartment and in the neighbourhood. As the other reviews say, it is actually a minute away from the métro and seconds away from as many bars, restaurants and food shops as you could hope to find. We particularly enjoyed the French Bastards bakery just round the corner but you are spoiled for choice. We would also recommend Peppe Pizzeria at the top of the Rue des Martyres. Unlike many Parisian apartments, there is a lift (one of the world's smallest) which is a boon after a long day seeing the sights. The very many bars and clubs in the area can mean it is loud at night in Pigalle, but because Camille's bedroom is behind the living room, you can sleep undisturbed. It is a real privilege to get to stay in someone's home like this, and we can't recommend it highly enough. Thank you!",2023-11-05T15:55:09Z,5

The place is very nice, clean, lots of storage for your clothes. The neighborhood is just great. The apartment windows face the interior court, so it is quiet like in a country side, however in the block you can find places from the fanciest (and a very nice vegetarian place) to the cheapest and coolest you can find in Paris. Nice 15 min walk to Galeries Lafayette, different metro stations are very close, bio grocery store 5 min walk and a Carrefour on the corner of the street opened till 11 pm, rare thing in Paris! I come to Paris several times a year for my studies, so will definitely book this place for my next stay.",2015-06-17T13:29:12Z,5

His apartment was very easy to find.  Unfortunately, our train from London to Paris was delayed.  Ronan was so kind to wait up for us and to make sure we arrived okay.  Ronan helped us with our luggage up 4 flights of stairs.  He showed us where everything is located in the apartment and provided us with the wifi instructions.  Ronan also prepared a binder that consisted of nearby restaurants, cafes, bars and tourist brochures.  He also left manuals and instructions for the washer, toaster and TV.  He was very detailed and organized.  The apartment is a good size for a couple.  I particular love the artwork displayed on the wall.  It had everything we needed for a week in Paris.  It's in a good location.  The apartment is located between two metro stations off the 5 and 7 lines.  There are many restaurants, cafes, bars and markets nearby.  The apartment is located by the canal.  On a sunny day we enjoyed taking walks or picnicking along the canal with the locals.  There's a cute bistro below our building.  It was always busy with locals.  A great neighborhood away from the hustle and bustle of the center.  I definitely recommend Ronan's apartment.  Thanks for welcoming us into your home.

Ronan is a great host and met us when we arrived to show us around the apartment and tell us everything we needed to know. He had a book with info about how to work the TV etc and with some directions to nearby food places and shops. 
Communication was easy and he always replies quickly if you have any questions.
Due to my clumsiness I broke a frame that was on the wall! Ronan was extremely understanding and we were able to come to a quick and easy resolution to sort it out :)

I had a really good stay at Ronans apartment. Ronan is a very affectionate and kind person. He gave me a really openhearted
welcome, explained me everything I needed to know and gave me some good tips for bars and restaurants.

The apartment is VERY,VERY beautiful. It is really comfortable, quiet and very clean. A nice bed - where I had a few good quiet sleeps. A kitchen equipped with everything you need for cooking. A small but comfortable and clean bathroom. 
The neighbours are very friendly. 

Near to the apartment there is a nice canal with bars and a cinema. You can make a nice walk a long the canal. 
Near to the apartment you will find a lot of shops and supermarkets. 
With the subway, which is close, you can get to the centre.

All in all I can really recommend - it's a fair price for a nice apartment. 

Thank you Ronan for your trust and your kindness!!!

Wish you all the best,
Varya

We loved the artsy atmosphere of the apartment due to great overall design and must-to-read collections of books, comics and artworks. The location of the flat is really near to metro station so it was very easy to reach any part of the city. Also, within a few minutes of walk you can get to a bit noisier streets and feel charming night life of Paris. Gabriel was really polite and helpful with any question or request.

The apartment was smaller than I expected but it was enough space for my boyfriend and I during our anniversary weekend. It was the perfect distance from the lively part of the city.

7110643,216434793,Emily,"A charming flat in a beautiful little locked courtyard area, and located in a wonderful neighbourhood.  Although I didn't meet Julien, he arranged for his friend to give me the keys and both were very helpful to sort out a time.  His friend was very personable and also kind to carry my suitcase up the stairs (it is only one small flight though so would not be a problem).  

There was a small miscommunication with regards to wifi but Julien was very quick to sort out the problem and even offered for me to take a beer to say sorry which I thought was very kind.

The flat felt very homely and I thoroughly enjoyed my stay there - perfect for a single person or for a couple (as was my situation).  The flat was clean and tidy, but did not feel like a hotel - which is exactly what I look for in an Airbnb.  It felt like staying at a friends house, which was perfect.

I stayed one night alone and felt extremely safe, which I consider very important.  Overall I would highly recommend and will definitely be in touch again when I am next in Paris!",2018-10-08T13:48:21Z,5

Very little noise from the street (but being an apartment in the city you do get some noise from neighbours). Be quick with the shower as hot water runs out fast - apparently common in Paris apartments!

The apartment is very clean, has amazing internet speed, large flat screen tv, cool shower with a built in radio and a comfortable bed. He left us a bottle of wine when we arrived, a very sweet gesture. We recommend this place to others. It's a 5 minutes or less walk to the train station, perfect if you want to get to Gare Nord station (we did-it was about three stops away) and about a 30 min ride from the Notre Dame via train and a SUPER secure building (you need three codes to get inside).

3626934,57242801,Mateus,"Edouard was really nice, the apartament is as described in the pictures, close to public trasnport. The only problem we had, which was unfortunate, was the bed condition and the pilows. While we thought it was a mattress problem, it actually was the bed itself that was broken and we found it very difficult to find a position to sleep. We did not sleep well for the four nights we were there and that hurts anyone after a really long flight. I told Edouard about it and he apologized and said he would fix it for next time, unfortunately it is a lot of money spent for 4 nights of not sleeping well. As our first experience in airbnb i had higher expectations.",2016-05-13T03:19:51Z,3

3626934,42210118,Mark,"Edouard's flat was the perfect base on my recent trip to Paris. The flat was presently spotless with all amenities that anyone would ever need. I especially liked how I could use the Smart TV to login to my Netflix account when it was raining! The kitchen is well stocked with equipment, pots and pans so cooking was easy. The flat was as shown in all the pictures and was well furnished. The bed was certainly innovative but beware that it is still quite high (~1.5m) even when lowered so not one for those prone to falling out of bed in the night!

I found the apartment easily after a 30 minute walk from Gare du Nord. The nearby canal makes a lovely walk into the centre of Paris or the nearby Parc de la Villette and I made use of the Velib bike hire nearby to easily get into the centre. There is a largely segregated cycle route that runs alongside the canal and into the centre. About 50 metres from the apartment block is a Franprix mini-market which I found useful for all the basic supplies that you will need when self-catering. There is also a butcher and bakery, amongst others, on the same street.

I was shown around the flat on my arrival my Edouard's friend but I had been in contact with Edouard via the Airbnb app from when I booked to when I arrived.  I also had to check-out early so unfortunately did not get to meet Edouard. I felt sure that had I had any issues that Edouard would have tried his best to sort them out.

I would have no hesitation in recommending this apartment to individuals or couples looking for a roomy and excellent value alternative to a regular hotel stay in Paris. Excellent value for money!",2015-11-22T11:22:18Z,5

Things to know:
- the area directly around the apartment can feel a little sketchy at times. But walking just a couple blocks and you’re in nicer areas.",2023-08-19T13:30:02Z,4

21073004,351858003,Bianca,"The house is super nice and cozy, the furniture is very well arranged. In Paris I had very bad experiences in the past, therefore when I arrived there and saw a very nice apartment with a lot of light: it was a very nice feeling.
The area is quite ethnic but super central: 25 mins walking from Les Marais.

Considering everything I would advise to go there.",2023-10-08T14:48:43Z,5
21073004,1878946,Clark,"Stay here. Paris has too many choices, just book this one--the neighborhood is fun and convenient, the apartment is stylish, charming, and feels like using your cool friend's place. Great ""real paris"" diverse, fun neighborhood; 10 steps from 2 Metro lines); walk to dozens of non-touristy restaurants, nightlife areas like Canal St. Martin and Oberkampf--so much more fun than stuffy Marais, pricey 6th, or touristy Latin Quarter. The apartment is like having your own place in Paris--great windows/velux, views to a great street, excellent shower, comfy couch, av system, great kitchen, espresso machine, sodastream, and a great local's guidebook. As for Gaelle and Alex, they were so helpful and flexible (and we needed a bit of flex, and they helped us out without hesitation). The ideal AirBNB hosts. They say in their site that this is a home and not just a rental--and they really mean it--they totally trust their guests, and that feels great.

32278714,24560601,Jonathan,"Roman was a fantastic host. The apartment was pristine and felt like a typical Parisian apartment - very comfortable setting and very short walk to several interesting neighborhoods (most famously Montmartre,) very convenient to Gare du Nord station, and steps away from the metro to other touristic areas of Paris. Roman was very communicative and he and his girlfriend do a fantastic job of making sure their guests have a great experience. I would definitely choose this apartment again on future trips to Paris. 

A small note: The neighborhood is very lively and there is a lot of local activity around the apartment building into the night. My friend and I did not feel in danger but females traveling alone may feel a bit uncomfortable going in/out of the building, like in any major city. Inside the apartment itself, it is very calm and quiet, even with the windows open.",2023-06-08T12:15:04Z,5

Al apartamento tenia la cara lavada con lo justo para ir a descansar y preparar algo de comer. El barrio no nos gusto mucho, pero esta bien comunicado. Nos sorprendio el contraste de ruido en la calle con la tranquilidad y el silencio del apartamento.

L'appartement est très bien situé; il y a une tonne de petits restos sympathiques dans les environs, un beau marché extérieur les jeudis et dimanches et le tout Paris est accessible à pied.  Le quartier est animé sans être bruyant. Si les gens attablés sur la terrasse du café de l'Industrie parlent trop fort, il suffit de fermer la fenêtre (bien insonorisée). Le logement est très confortable, idéal pour un couple. Le salon offre un espace spacieux pour relaxer après une promenade et pour prendre l'apéro; la petite cuisine possède tous les accessoires nécessaires; Sibylle et Romain nous avaient laissé plein d'espace de rangement dans la chambre à coucher qui possède un lit est confortable.

Compared to other apartments we've stayed at it's a actually a decent size for a studio. The bed is really comfy and not a pull out sofa. As described, the window allows a lot of light & offers great views of the Parisian rooftops. It faces the garden so it's very quiet with no traffic noise!  Unfortunately we didn't get to meet Tridbid but Tridbid was very thorough with his communication prior to our visit & ensured we enjoyed our stay. I would happily recommend Tridib's apartment to anyone visiting Paris.",2016-07-02T02:44:18Z,4

8602246,3500427,Barbara,"On the plus side, it's super bright and cheerful, the bathroom is tiny but great, the washing machine was a huge plus, and though the wifi didn't work while I was there, Elsa very considerately gave me a discount in cash. She's super nice, but the apartment needs some work.

Things to know on the con side: This apartment is in a building that keeps its trash just inside the door, so any time you enter or exit the building you're greeted with a cloud of garbage and bugs. The apartment itself is clean, although it's much more cluttered than you can see in the photos -- the bed is surrounded by open closets so you're sleeping in a closet, basically. I definitely felt like a student borrowing someone's dorm room for the weekend.

There's no fan or method of air circulation aside from the open windows, so my choice was to either get the night sweats or listen to people partying up and down the block. I heard several terrible renditions of ""Wannabe"" from a surprising variety of drunk French people between the hours of 1 and 3am, and one hilarious version of ""I feel like a woman,"" but I would have rather been asleep. I found the bed incredibly uncomfortable, though I suppose that is a personal preference. The host is really nice and I hate to write a negative review, but the above factors made this place generally unpleasant to stay at, if only because even with earplugs in it was impossible to get a full night's sleep at any point. Three stars for the price.",2016-07-16T00:10:57Z,3

There are grocery stores, bars and restaurants a-plenty. 
The only less-than-ideal aspect to Anne-Claire's beautiful apartment is it is located in what appears to be a red-light district (minus the red lights). Sex workers lined the Rue Ste Foy as well the neighboring streets Rue St. Denis and Boulevard St. Denis day and night.

Very welcoming entrance patio and a darling church bell ring you can hear from the place. Aida's generosity has been noticeble in many ways from her care about me before arrival and throught out.

À mon arrivé Aïda m'avait laissé un petit souvenir de Paris ainsi que sa carte Velib. Elle ne pouvait pas être présente lors de mon arrivé alors elle a demandé à sa mère Mysiane de m'accueillir, très gentille, prête à répondre à tout mes questions, donne de bon conseils pour aller visiter la ville ou sur les musées.  Aïda est très disponible par messages ou par Skype alors au moindre problème il y a moyen de communiquer avec elle, j'ai adoré mon expérience et je vous recommande cet appartement sans hésiter ",2017-04-19T09:36:12Z,5

Our host left a binder on the coffee table with suggestion on local restaurants.  The bed was very comfortable.  I agree with some of the other reviews regarding the noise.  There are a couple of bars/restaurants across the street & the noise was consistent every night.  If you are a light sleeper, definitely take a ear plugs or a white noise machine etc...  The apartment had everything we needed & was a quick walk to a local market & up to Moulin Rouge.  We went to the show for my boyfriends 40th birthday.   This apartment does not have an elevator.  We got used to the stairs pretty quickly, however, for some, it may be too much.  I was very pleased with my stay & would stay here again.",2019-05-10T13:17:23Z,5
26247315,7171699,Bradley,"Great apartment; much larger and brighter than expected. Two disappointments were the neighborhood and abundace of personal belongings that crowded in on us. The immediate three- block area is upscale, but it is a gentrified island in the middle of much less desireable neighborhoods on all sides. As far as personal items, the owner left notes and warnings not to touch his things, rather than appropriately clear out the apartment. The kids' bedroom and master closet were locked  off with chains and with a minimum of effort all personal items could have been taken out of the way by putting them there. There was  no closet space for hanging clothes",2019-05-04T11:59:02Z,4
26247315,16724983,Adam,"We had a decent time at Loic's place. The price was good for the time we were there and the locations and views of the city were really stunning. There were a few things to note, there was no hair dryer and only French TV, so if you visit be sure and bring something to access netflix or your own shows if you aren't French. This may not bother some, but you are staying in someones home when they are not there, so expect lots of kids toys, personal photos and kids drawings on the walls in the bedroom. For a romantic vacation, it felt a little like staying at our cousins house, and not like a rental as you may expect. Overall, it was a good place if you are there to explore and not spend a lot of time in the room. Expect 5 flights of stairs on a tight spiral staircase as well, this wouldn't be ideal for anyone with issues with stairs. (I know stairs are listed, but these are some STAIRS)",2019-03-11T15:10:56Z,4

26247315,5097548,Leslie,"This apartment is a lovely light filled classic French floor apartment on a quiet street in a pretty accessible part of town. Common in older homes, the floors squeak and the home is decorated with small accessories (like any loved home) that one has to be careful not to accidentally brush into. Overall a nice place to stay. Never met Loïc, the check in/out was through a restaurant down the street that had the key. Kind of strange, but when we had questions we got a response within a day from the host. Better to bring your own amenities like soap and lotion, and for the ladies, there is no hairdryer provided. Basic needs meet. So if your up for a steep climb up 4 flights of stairs this is probable the place for you...just don’t forget anything downstairs 🙂",2019-01-21T14:39:16Z,4

26247315,134615745,Erika,"We really enjoyed our stay here! The apartment was exactly as advertised, and very comfortable. There were more restaurants and bakeries nearby than we’d thought based on our Google Maps explorations before we came. The walk to the metro is very reasonable, even in less than ideal weather. The view down the street is lovely and the whole space is well-lit. The 4th floor (5th floor U.S.) walk-up is as expected- but you get used to it fast. The apartment is on the same street as a club/bar, so the evenings were often full of shouting and loud talking (we stayed for a solid week, it was pretty consistent). We used a sound machine app and were fine, but if you’re a light sleeper this could get on your nerves. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay and we would absolutely stay here again. Love the apartment, enjoyed the area, and Loic was great.",2018-12-24T14:51:29Z,5

The space is stunning. A winding spiral staircase may be daunting for some, but truly iconic in the design. Loic’s place is a corner unit that gets morning and late afternoon sun. Open all the windows for an amazing cross breeze and the most picturesque view down Rue des Martyrs. All of the fixtures, bathroom and the kitchen are completely renovated. There is the charm of old world, with new world touches.

When I’m back in Paris, I will most certainly be staying here!

24485163,171123120,Kayla,Perfect location and view! Lots of cafes and shops nearby. The place is great if your alone or a group of four. There was no issues and Antoine and his sister-in-law are amazing if you have any questions. The only thing this place needs is a fan if you visit during the summer. It was fantastic!:),2019-06-26T13:41:28Z,5

24485163,158651815,Therese,"Antoine’s place was bright, sunny and had such a lovely view of the Tour Eiffel. It was warm during our stay but the large balcony windows open wide for a cool breeze. We were so happy with the amenities and the location - near groceries, metro and some lovely cafes (Qu’a Fait Merlin was our favorite). It was a very easy commute to and from tourist locations from Pere Lachaise metro and returning to Antoine’s apartment felt like coming home each night. Just be careful not to trip on the cowhide rug ;)",2018-05-31T12:21:46Z,5
24485163,48990281,Mason,"The balcony view was amazing. I can see Effiel tower from far. Mattress was pretty comfortable. WiFi doesn't work with our cellphones. It was very stressful to deal with the WiFi. We have 3 people but only one set of key to share was a bit inconvenience.

Antoine is a great host who replies quickly and the key handover was easy & uncomplicated. The kitchen is perfectly equipped.

Located in a quiet area, it was easy to find nearby grocery/bakery stores, restaurants, and access to public transportation was convenient. The place was clean and furnished with everything that we needed (note that there is no television, although we did not miss it).

24485163,7116948,Maria,"Good location, however, the management agency is not receptive. We had to wait outside the building for half an hour and when the person arrived he was not sure on which floor the apartment was located. Later on when I requested larger towels as only hand towels were provided the agency said there was a charge. Finally, after several emails and pictures of the towels, they said that not even for a fee we could get larger towels. Not a major issue however, the lack of custmoer care was blatant.

24485163,42081169,Jessica,"A really stylish and modern apartment in a great location! Close to 2 metro stations, cafes, grocery stores, right opposite a little park and felt safe even at night. A little tight on space for 3-4 adults with the sofa bed out (though a large and comfy sofa bed!) but the view from the windows more than made up for it. The separate toilet is also in a pretty small space but the bathroom/shower was a good size. The apartment had everything that we needed - basic cooking goods, pots/pans, laundry rack etc. Thanks Antoine and Luckey Homes!",2018-08-02T12:22:19Z,5
24485163,109869711,Kathy,"Amazing view of the city during the day and at night, everything about it was really homely. great hairdryer!! like a home from home. would recommend for city breaks. Pretty small but was perfect for four adults. sofa bed was really comfortable. Really well laid out for such a small space. Metro was just a few minutes walk and probably around 10-15 minutes to the city centre (champs-élysées, eiffel tower.... most tourist attractions) Plenty of little cafe’s and supermarkets are less than a 5 minutes walk. And to top it off you wake up to a view of the eiffel tower every morning. Once again would highly recommend.",2018-07-06T14:09:03Z,5
24485163,105309498,Sivananthan,"Location is good, bear-by lots of restaurant. The house management communication was swept and nice staffs attend us with some good advise. 
Clean linen, towels, all you need for simple cooking, kettle, oven, microwave all is there. The good part is you can see eiffel tower and has good view from the apartment. 
We had major issue sleeping at night since no Air conditioning for summer at night is really warm. If you closed the shade no air incoming, if open the shade its too bright to sleep. We really suffer first night kids in the room unable to sleep, next day I slept in the room and I cant sleep and sweating. Its still good choice apartment apart from summer maybe, I was very unlucky and really had tough time. Antoine allowed me to buy fan and promised to reimburse, hopefully he will do. The fan did help a bit. Still suggest to have Ventilator or AC at least as tourist after 18hrs flight and with young kids it too much to go through. Thx",2018-07-03T15:00:06Z,3

The apartment was very dirty, the floor, the shower, the sheets were already used by other people.

Finally we received a visit from the landlord of the apartment, which was not Adrien himself but another guy. Adrien told us about this visit just the same day, without us being able to answer if we were ok or not.

I suggest everybody to avoid this listing and Airbnb to remove it from the website.",2015-07-17T12:03:55Z,1

The apartment is located on the 7th floor, which is a bit of a workout but well worth the effort once you get up there as it is typical Parisien and very cosy! The place was clean and had everything you need, like a French Press coffee pot. I met Adrien at his workplace closeby to drop off the keys which was fine since I needed to leave in the middle of the day and I did book so short notice. All in all a great experience!",2015-05-20T15:54:01Z,5

But Paris is a big city, so take the metro:-) We could not have asked for a better place to stay. It was a very small cosy parisian loft-apartment. 
We truly enjoyed our stay and Adrian is a very helpful and friendly guide to the not so touristed parts of Paris. The real Paris. There is one minor thing: It´s on the 7th floor and no elevator, so pack light! I loved the stairs! It forced me to exercise every day, ergo I could eat more cake. It was awesome.

He's kind, accommodating, explains everything well, and wverything in the apartment is exactly as advertised. There are different areas for working, including a folding table that is really nice and sturdy. If you're there for work you have the folding table as well as the table/desk in the corner. I'm always worried about not having enough desk space, but I had plenty.

Moreover, the apartment is superbly located--not too far from all of the touristy sites if you enjoy walking along the Seine, plus there are many things to do and see in the Quartier Latin, and it's very close to the Jardin des Plantes also. Right across the street from the metro, it's also incredibly convenient--easy to get everywhere! It's a lovely, cozy place!!",2023-01-21T13:02:59Z,5
33827090,243967414,Howard,"Great space for one or two people with a great host! The apartment was exactly as described and laid out very well for the amount of space. We cooked several meals and had everything we needed in terms of pans, plates, cutlery, etc. It is across the street from the Metro, a few blocks from three different grocery stores and maybe a five minute walk to the Seine. Stéphane could not have been more gracious as a host–holding our bags for us when we arrived before check-in, offering restaurant recommendations and suggestions on getting to the airport, etc. We would definitely stay here again. Thank you, Stéphane!",2022-11-27T15:48:37Z,5
33827090,18069534,Mark,"This is an absolutely fantastic location, and Stephane was a great host. This apartment is a great value. If someone doesn't mind a small apartment, it is perfect. The entry is maybe 100 yards from the metro, and there are many restaurants within 100 yards. Small: the double bed takes up maybe 25% of the main living space. The table is folded, and one chair is folded and stored in the small WC. The shower is maybe 2 feet by two feet, but the water is warm and has good pressure. This did not matter to us because we spent most of our time exploring Paris!

So: Great value, small apartment, excellent location, great host. I would go back.",2022-10-25T11:38:37Z,5

He provided a very detailed list of nearby restaurant/activity recommendations, and was always available to answer questions! Check-in was fast and easy, and the apartment was in a perfect central location. It was small but that's typical for Paris -- the size was perfect for my boyfriend and myself!

Location is super close to metro lines that make visits to Eiffel Tower and Sacré-Cœur a breeze -- or simply walk as you're mere blocks away from the Seine River, Notre-Dame Cathedral, and of course Berthillon Glacier for all you ice cream fans. After my stay, I jumped on a train to Lyon from Gare de Lyon station, which is also conveniently close. Stéphane is a friendly, genuine, and responsive host, full of recommendations to make the best of your stay. Would definitely stay here again.",2019-07-02T11:34:59Z,5

The Metro entrance is on the other side of the street making it easy to visit the places you want to explore. We loved the rustic stairs to the third floor, but they can be challenging if you have staircases. But Stéphane helped us meet the challenge. He is very friendly and willingly offers suggestions on attractions to visit and tips on getting around Paris.  We would love to return on our next trip to Paris.

Linda's style and decor are beautiful, and there's just enough character to give the flat its own special charm. There is a girls school on the backside of the apartment, so you may be woken by the playful cheers as the girls go into school each morning, but not a bad wake up call. Linda was easy to work with and very communicate tube, making the whole transaction a breeze. Recommended. ",2015-07-02T14:15:14Z,5

Linda was a great host, very available to help up work out the wifi and washing machine. She had recommendations of things to do nearby as well as more practical help. You can see the Moulin Rouge from the front door and at night we were pretty excited to be able to see the Eiffel Tower from the bedroom window.

Their place is located on a quiet street which is very close to Pantheon. From one of the window you could see the dome. The RER station Luxembourg is nearby so it is easy to go to the airport and other remote areas by train. The apartment is well equipped and thoughtfully decorated.

At check-in she was quite aggressive and not welcoming at all, even though we were quite accommodating to her endless list of rules. During the stay she was not responsive, she gave the wrong Wifi information and only fixed them a day later. At checkout she asked to do the checkout late, which we happily accommodated through a friend of ours. Even though we left the place absolutely spotless and were accommodating, she was extremely rude to my friend, and was unnecessarily paranoid about her rules without a shred of evidence and made us feel incredibly uncomfortable. It’s unfortunate given the place but I would not recommend dealing with her.",2023-01-01T15:05:42Z,3

Die Wohnung liegt in einer sehr guten Gegend gut öffentlich erreichbar und auch in der Nähe von einigen Vélib-Stationen. Die belebteren Straßen des Marais sind unmittelbar zu Fuß erreichbar und auch die Gassen direkt rund um die Wohnung haben einige Restaurants, eine hervorragende Bäckerei und einen wöchentlichen Markt zu bieten. Das Bett war sehr bequem, in Küche und Bad war alles notwendige vorhanden
Leider ist die Wohnung etwas hellhörig. Wenn also die Nachbarn am Samstag Abend feiern, kann man die Gespräche und die Musik zum Teil mithören. Da das jedoch nur  an einem einzigen Mal Abend der Fall war, ist das wohl eher die Ausnahme und dadurch vernachlässigbar.

1749935,48350138,Paul,"Bertrand's place was fantastic. It had everything we needed to see Paris. It's nice and clean and large enough to feel cozy in while still being affordable.  Bertrand was timely and attentive and made two Americans feel like they could explore the best that Paris had to offer.

It's a nice 20-30 minute or so walk to the Seine and all the attractions therein. I wish we would have had more time to explore the local neighborhood because it's definitely far enough away from the touristy spots that it feels like an authentic Parisian hangout. 

My one recommendation if you stay at this area is to check out Au Passage for dinner one night. I had two of the best plates in my life there in a great atmosphere. Thanks Bertrand!",2018-11-12T14:50:15Z,5

The closest metro station is less than 5 min walk away. There is a carrefour supermarket that is about 5 to 7 min walk from his studio and there are several great restaurants within a 20 min walk or a metro stop away. The closest is Losteria Dell'Anima, an awesome Italian restaurant that serves freshly made pasta that is about a 3 to 4 min walk in the same direction as the Oberkamf metro station but closer.

It has a washer, no dryer, but there is a drying rack which works fine. We did have a little trouble with the lock on the front door the first night but eventually figured it out so my tip would be to check into that before leaving for the first time.

The apartment was exactly as described, except it should say he has the best shower in Europe.  Bertrand provided all the necessary info, such as how to operate the awesome TV, washing machine, and directions to important sites in Paris.  He always responded quickly to any questions we texted to him.  The quiet neighborhood was typical Paris.  Get a multi-day Metro/bus pass and Paris is yours.

The pictures do not do it justice.  Simon was very helpful and responded quickly to every question before check-in and during our stay.  He is a considerate host who went out of his way to make sure we were comfortable, letting us check out late and even leaving some bread and wine for us since we arrived so late.

Our flights got changed on us to and from, and he was extremely accommodating, making what could have been a stressful situation quite easy. His apartment exemplifies why we love Airbnb— not only did it feel personal and carefully designed, it allowed us to feel very Parisian (..with our broken French and overstuffed totes) for a few days.

Its location is great, right in the heart of Montmartre, with many restaurants, bakeries, and grocery shops within a 2min walk (try the crepes and macaroons at the end of the Rue Tholoze). Two Metro stops (Abbesses, line 12, and Blanche, line 2) are within a 7-8min walk. The view from Simon's apartment is spectacular, and we enjoyed sitting in the front of the windows and looking at the Tour Eiffel in the evenings. Simon was very (!) helpful, he welcomed us to his apartment, and provided a lot of information. Simon also answered all questions very quickly when we contacted him.

Finally, it was a pretty easy place to work--fast wifi and a nice desk setup.

4603069,278655984,Dori,"The two of us loved staying in Simon’s place!  The area s my favorite because it is out of the heavily touristed area, and you feel more like you are living in Paris.  We took advantage of Studio 28, the local cinema around the corner.  Several metro stops are very close, so easy to get to most parts of the city.  The kitchen has really nice appliances and there is a corner market one block away, so I always had my breakfast at home.  The bathroom is great with good water pressure and a rain head shower that was really nice.  My husband was very happy with the especially nice iron and ironing board, haha😄. And of course, the best part, you are overlooking Paris from 4 of the windows!  There are also windows in every room!  Even kitchen and bathroom, so it’s very good light all the time. All the Eiffel Tower at night never gets old for me.  We really loved our time in Simon’s apartment!  And Simon was a great host!  Always available to answer any questions, and very discerning of his neighborhood, with great recommendations for us.  Thank you so much Simon!",2019-10-01T13:11:48Z,5

Simon is extremely courteous and communicative, he even made our stay possible on short notice. We had everything we needed and more (fresh bread, eggs, butter, milk and enough coffee to last our stay). The stairs are indeed quite a climb, but if you have the health to make the 5 flights, it is worth it. We loved spending time with the view and the breeze in the evenings. Would absolutely stay here again and highly recommend.",2018-09-24T12:30:23Z,5
4603069,2722239,Jaclyn,"My husband and I LOVED our stay at Simon's place. The apartment looks exactly as pictured and the view is just incredible. We loved waking up and going to bed with a view of the Eiffel tower. The location is really great! Easy to travel into the center of Paris by metro (usually a 15-30 min metro) and the neighborhood is so neat. Montmarte is full of artistic inspiration and history. The apartment is situated on a perfect cobblestone alley (near Vincent van Gogh's house!) - you really feel like you're getting the Paris experience. Plus, we were pleasantly surprised to find that we were very close to amazing bakeries and restaurants (and one of the best creperies in town!). The neighborhood always felt lively and safe - which we appreciated. Yes, the apartment is located on the top floor and there are quite a few staircases to climb but, we always welcomed the exercise after eating our way through the city - we needed it! The living room and bedroom have large windows that provided a wonderful fresh breeze. We loved enjoying a glass of wine while looking at the Eiffel tower. The place is nicely decorated with art and the floor to ceiling book shelves filled with books were so neat to peruse. Bed was super comfy. Shower was large and had great water pressure. My husband enjoyed the Nespresso machine. 

Simon was also a very generous host. When our flight was early, he let us check-in much earlier than anticipated and he provided some of the best restaurant recommendations we had on our trip, including an Italian restaurant  just a 3 minute walk from the apartment. 

We feel like we totally lucked out and would definitely stay here again!",2018-06-22T12:48:45Z,5

Besides the very good location the apartment itself has the Parisian charm to it.  It was very pleasant to wake up in and come back to after days of sightseeing.  The apartment is a little larger than it looks on the pictures.  It’s clean, minimalist and had everything we needed.

Great features - Location. - right in the heart of old Paris within walking distance of many attractions, easy public transit,  nearby stores and restaurants.   Quiet - The apartment is located on a side street with little noise.   The bedroom fronts an even quieter  back courtyard.  Amenities -  Spacious primary rooms, well equipped kitchen,  comfortable double bed, modern appliances. 
 We were met by the concierge and an English speaking neighbor to orient us to the apartment.   Dominique was easily available by Email and a small issue (of extra keys) was easily resolved.    The only minor annoyance was the squeaky wooden floors mentioned in the listing.   This meant that we could hear the upstairs neighbors  walking above us and we had to be mindful that our downstairs neighbors could be disturbed by us.  It was easy to adapt to this.

Tolle Verkehrsanbindung in der Nähe von Gare de l’Est und Gare du Nord. Caroline antwortet schnell und zuverlässig und auch die Schlüsselübergabe funktionierte reibungslos. Ich freue mich schon auf meinen Besuch im nächsten Jahr!,2018-06-03T13:59:48Z,4

16848231,24047351,Salomé,"L'appartement de Caroline se trouve à proximité de différents commerces (supermarché en face, boulangerie à côté...). Bien qu'un peu à l'écart des centres touristiques parisiens, il est situé dans un quartier calme, ce qui permet de bien se reposer et il est bien desservi par le métro et des bus. En outre, le bâtiment est très beau et le studio a une vue à la cour interne, propre et sympa.
Nous n'avons par connu Caroline personnellement mais elle a été très réactive à nos messages et a prévu un accueil pour nous. Elle nous a laissé son appart très propre, des guides de Paris, des produits pour le petit déjeuner... Bref, un excellent accueil. Nous remercions vivement Caroline pour sa gentillesse et espérons pouvoir nous loger chez elle à nouveau prochainement!",2018-04-02T14:30:10Z,5

16848231,14778781,Anja,"Carolines Appartement ist perfekt für zwei Personen. Die Lage ganz in der Nähe der Bahnhöfe ist super. Die Hauptattraktionen sind alle innerhalb von 30 Minuten per Metro zu erreichen. Die Metrostation Riquet ist direkt um die Ecke. Ich liebe den Canal d'Ourq, man kann diesen schön entlangspazieren. Direkt vor dem Haus  auf dem Mittelstreifen zwischen den Fahrbahnen war ein netter Flohmarkt  (ich weiss allerdings nicht, ob er jeden Samstag stattfindet). Das Appartement war zwar relativ klein, aber es war alles vorhanden: Küchenecke, Ess-, Bad. Man konnte alle Utensilien, auch die Gewürze etc. benutzen, was gerade bei einem kurzen Aufenthalt sehr praktisch ist. Die Wohnung befindet sich im 5. Stock eines Hinterhauses mit schönem Blick auf den Innenhof. Die ganze Komplex ist sehr sauber und gepflegt und wir fühlten uns sehr sicher. Meine Tochter und ich hatten eine tolle Zeit und haben uns in das Appartement verliebt. Wir kommen gerne wieder!",2017-04-30T09:49:34Z,4

22398948,121556815,Beth,"Alessandra was extremely responsive and helpful, especially being flexible with check in. Her apartment was very clean and as described. We found the in unit stairs to be a bit tricky, but going down them backwards worked out. The windows provided air flow as well as excellent natural light, and the neighborhood had great restaurants as well as easy metro access. To note for those sensitive to higher temperatures: when the weather outside gets above 32 C/90 F, the apartment can become quite warm and stuffy, even when using the fan and windows.",2023-07-11T13:37:06Z,5

If you want to get the real Parisian experience, this is it: the studio is ideally located close to several subway stations in a lively neighborhood in central Paris. The place itself offers a calm respite after a busy day outside. It's got a great atmosphere and felt instantly like home.
Bonus points: the inner courtyard is super cute, with lots of plants and a few seats to take a break outside, read a book, and pet the local cats.",2023-06-20T14:26:40Z,5

It’s located very close to the 9 subway line, which is an easy commute to the Trocadero and other places. There is also a Monoprix grocery store very close by.

I felt very secure in the building, and was glad that the unit had a washing machine. (Not sure if it is also a dryer combo, I couldn’t figure out that part). Be mindful that this unit is on the fifth floor if you are planning to bring a lot of luggage, as there are a lot of stairs and no elevator (this is standard in a lot of older building in Paris). Alessandra was very nice and helped me with my bags up all five flights of stairs. Overall a great stay, I had an enjoyable experience in Paris.",2023-04-12T11:49:30Z,5

I would say here ever time I visit Paris. we stay for 12 nights and it was amazing.
location is great too, just 15 minutes walk to champs Elysees, Tuileries and more.

3707580,916358,Gigi,"Alice is very kind and fast to respond when you need something. The apartment is lovely and I was so pleased with how quiet it is! Even though it is very central and in a lively neighborhood, the windows face inner courtyards, keeping out most of the city noise. The bed is pretty comfortable for a sofa bed. The shower has good pressure. The wifi works well. 

The one strange thing is that there is no kitchen trash can, which I've never encountered before in an Airbnb. Also it appears to be someone's full-time residence, because there is a lot of food in the kitchen and no real storage space to unpack a bag or store your own food. It was fine for me because I was alone and just kept my cereal and bread and such on the counter in the kitchen, but if you are coming for longer and hoping to have some cabinet space, make sure to ask the host (she is lovely, so I assume she would make some space for you if you need it).",2022-08-10T12:18:13Z,4

The apartment is very quiet and the living room has an spectacular and intimate view. 

Alice has done a wonderful job with the decoration and furniture. I love the hangers in the hallway. 

The bathroom is a real ""bath room"", the toilette is separated from the bathroom. Is gorgeous.

You can sleep profoundly with the electrical blinders that bring the room to complete darkness. If you have a late morning, you may barely hear a neighbor play classical music. Very talented and such an inspiring way to start your day. ",2015-08-08T16:21:22Z,5

There are a lot of restaurants, stores and cafe (Tabac as French call them :) around. Three mins walk to the nearest metro station. The neighbourhood is pretty safe though I must admit I always return before dark. The apartment is spacious and comfortable. It could be helpful if there would be a microwave and a few bowls, but all in all, you have most stuff you need. 

Great value for money and we highly recommend this place!",2019-04-16T14:21:14Z,5

26979129,34614734,Nancy,This was a perfectly located apartment. It’s a few steps away from a metro stop that allows one to access all of Paris’ special spots within 15-25 min. It’s also located in an area with a lot of people so we felt safe walking to and from even late at night. The restaurants around this place are AMAZING. Please note that this place is very basic and is probably comfortable for 2 people max. This place was appropriate for its simple priced value.,2019-02-22T12:44:44Z,3
26979129,7661623,Walt & Michelle,A great place to stay!  My wife and I wanted to be in Monmartre because of the local area as well as it’s location and ease to get to the other area is Paris.  It’s close to 2 metro stops.  Lime scooters can be found easily as well.  There are plenty of choices for food and entertainment as well.

26377182,106877126,Mada,"We had a really enjoyable stay for a week in May. The apartment is mostly as the pictures show. Had everything we needed, including iron and ironing board. The shower has hot water and the pressure is perfect. It was a bit cold during our stay, and there is no heating controlled from the apartment. But the cover made up for that during the evening.

Some small downsides: 
- The toilet space is very small, depending on your size it might pose a challenge to use it. Not unusable, just challenging. Also, the toilet space has no ventilation.
- The shower is in the same room as the bedroom (see pics). No issue for us, bear in mind depending on who you share with.

The area is great - open air market with fruits, veggies, seafood and tons of pastries. Full of shops, restaurants and boulangeries, not touristy. Close to metro stations and to Parc Monceau.

Justine was great, kept in touch, replied quickly to questions and the communication went smoothly. Key from hotel nearby w/ 24h service.",2023-05-22T11:33:42Z,5

(OK, maybe not the actual madame concierge, but the concierge rooms are there.) Quite a charming spot set off from the hustle and bustle of the Parisian streets. The Chateau d'Eau metro station is right around the corner, and a short walk takes you to the Porte St. Martin and the Boulevard Saint-Denis with its many theaters, cafes, and restaurants.

Nice living room with good quality sofa and chairs and very useful kitchen. Electrical heating system works very well. Bedroom bigger than expected with very good quality bed. Nice shower.

Positive things: The apartment is charming, with a great feel for classical music and films. There is a beautiful and well-tuned piano. There were clean towels and space in the cabinet to unpack your suitcase, as well as a washer. Frédéric was very good with communication throughout, and helping with checking in, problems, and checking out. 

Negative things: The apartment is on a back garden, so there’s not much of a view. It wasn’t 100% clean, but not too bad.

If you’re looking for a reasonable place for your stay in Paris, I’d recommend it.",2018-08-16T12:21:11Z,4

20672669,214667157,Chris,"A great value for money if you're looking for a nice private space to relax after a hard day of exploring the city. The apartment itself is relatively small but conveniently organised and extremely cosy. The location of the place is well situated near a local bakery, atm and the metro so we had no problems getting around. Marie is a lovely host, leaving a booklet filled with notes and suggestions of activities to do. Although we never met her, she was very quick to reply to texts. 
The amenities were all in place, it seems to be her apartment so it's well stocked. 
The only inconvenience I would make notice of, is that the toilet is confined in a very tight space. Making a struggle for someone of regular height like me to squeeze into. It made for an entertaining experience at least. 
Overall I'd say a bargain if you're looking to share or spend time with your S.O. Would definitely visit again.",2019-03-25T13:40:35Z,5

La cocina es muy cómoda y Marie nos dejó café para desayunar.  La cama era muy cómoda y no se oye nada de ruido. La ducha también genial. El piso parecía muy seguro. Lo único a tener en cuenta es que hay que subir muchas escaleras, no hay ascensor. Y el lavabo es muy pequeño. En general estuvimos muy bien en su casa. :) ¡Gracias, Marie!",2019-04-19T13:18:30Z,5

30755672,107080232,Rebecca,"I'm beginning this review with the fact that I'm not a clean freak and I absolutely loathe cleaning.  This place took the cake though...especially as people are PAYING to stay in it!

I arrived early evening from London.  Had to pick up keys from a nearby pub.  Walked to the apartment and after letting myself in, I thought someone else was in there as the smell of cigarette smoke was so fresh.  After opening the windows on both sides of apartment, the smell vanished a bit (I saw the ashtray out one of the windows, so the smell had definitely come from someone recently smoking it in the apartment).  

The bedroom.  Oh, I wish I could post the photos I took!  The bed was unmade, which I thought was strange.  Upon closer inspection, it looked as though the sheets had been slept in and hadn't been changed in over a month!  GROSS!!!!!  Couldn't find any others to replace them either.  Just pulled them off and slept on a sarong I had in my suitcase, with another sarong on top and then the blanket (the blanket cover hadn't been washed in a very long time too...YUCK!!!)

The bathroom.  Hair all over the floor.  No clean towels to use (the towels had obviously been used many times and had been left there to dry...they had a funny smell to them, so had to basically drip dry after the shower).  The shower hasn't had a good scrub in many months!  Black mould in the grout that I could wipe off with my finger.

The kitchen and living room were lovely though.  Looks like the kitchen was fairly new, hence no time to get dirty yet.  There were some dirty cups left in the sink though.

All in all, it was not a great experience.  It doesn't matter if it's cheap or if people are only staying one night, it still needs to be relatively clean!  It doesn't matter if the sheets or towels are old...they still need to be clean.  Preferably no smoking inside and leaving the windows closed also....not a great start when you walk into a room with a very strong smoke smell.

A definitely bachelor pad that needs to either be cleaned up, or not available for rent on AirBnB!",2019-11-03T14:54:04Z,2

The location is great, too, a beautiful neighborhood, with a lot of restaurants, cafés, and bars, and very good metro connections. You only have to be able to ignore the street noises, the big avenue is always very busy, also at night. 
Emmanuelle was very nice, communicating with her was easy.
We would definitely recommend to stay at Emmanuelle's!",2018-10-01T11:59:32Z,5

While Lucie could not meet us herself she arranged for her friend to show us around instead who we found very friendly and helpful- even saving us a parking space on the street. Inside the flat Lucie ensured we had all the info we needed including recommendations in the area, emergency contacts and so on. The flat itself is very warm and cosy with all the essentials provided. It is close to shops, restaurants and transport- a perfect position to explore the 'real Paris'. Only be prepared to climb a lot of stairs as is on the top floor...but this is normal in Paris!",2017-11-10T16:01:16Z,5

6298695,37971345,Joe,"We've just arrived home (18th June 2016) after staying at Audrey's apartment. This was our first ever Airbnb experience and we're a little bit apprehensive after the booking went through as using Airbnb was a bit of an alien experience for us! However, once we heard back from Audrey and eventually arrived at her apartment, there was no need to worry whatsoever!

After booking and prior to our arrival, she sent very detailed information about her apartment including how we would get the keys, how to access the apartment, access the wifi and some really good recommendations about the area.

On our arrival at Audreys apartment, we we're really happy with our booking. The place is very secure and once in the apartment, you've gone through 3 locked doors (roadside, apartment block and apartment).  The photos of her apartment were very representative of her place, very homely and very cosy and just right for us as a couple. It was clean and ready for us to settle in. It has everything you need for a stay, a home away from home. It's on the 3rd floor which is nice to be away from the street level and will also keep you fit by walking up the stairs! Don't worry however as their is a lift which will take you up there if needed!

The area of Bastille is a brilliant base to explore the city.  Very close to 2 metro lines which will get you anywhere in the city in no time but also a very vibrant area which you feel very safe in if you don't want to venture far out at night. Just down the road from the apartment, there's a lot of bars to enjoy. The majority of which drop their prices during happy hour (usually from 1700hrs to 2200hrs). There's also plenty of restaurants for both formal and informal dining. This along with a Carrefour City (Tesco Express style supermarket) over the road, lots of cafes and a brilliant bakery just on the corner of the next road for fresh croissants and baguettes for breakfast and lunch, makes the location of the apartment fantastic.

Check out (as well as check in) was simple and variable which was perfect for our Eurostar connections which means there was no hanging about and gave us more valuable time in this great city.

Throughout our stay Audrey was on hand via whatsapp to answer any queries we had, replying within the minute.

I would definitely recommend Audrey's apartment to friends and family and to you too, get booking!",2016-06-18T10:11:19Z,5
6298695,43119429,Caitlyn,"Audrey's flat was so lovely and she was very helpful with recommending things to do in Paris. Bastille is a great area - lots of bars and restaurants and a great vibe! The metro is a five minute walk away and Le Marais is a 15 minute walk with loads of great shopping.

It's close to the #3 metro line, but I usually took either bus 76 or 26 so I could see the city.  The 20th arondissement is pretty far out there, but still a reasonable distance to get to everything major.  There is a Franprix just down the street, which is a small grocery store.

18895545,120381977,Anderson,"The place where we stayed was very nice and quiet and had everything needed for a comfortable stay. Since there was no Air condition, we ventilated the apartment by keeping the windows open but left for uninvited guest late at night which ate us up.

The place seemed closer to all the tourists attractions on maps and on the listing,  however that was not the case. The place was very close to public transportation which took 45 minutes to an hour to get to. We did take uber which cut down the time to get to all the tourist stops.

Thomas was very friendly and always responded quickly. The check-in was seamless and check out as well. I would recommend for either a couple or with a friend. For a family accustomed to air conditioners this may not be the right pace. Overall I give it 3.5 out of five. Enjoyed the stay.",2017-07-12T12:55:45Z,4

Regarding the location, it's walking distance to Bastille station which connects to the subway stops of many popular spots to visit within Paris.  In fact, we never felt the need to navigate the busing system as we felt we could get to where wanted to go quite easily.

El departamento contaba con las comodidades y servicios ofrecidos, es tal cual las fotos.

2039764,28754927,Olivier,L'appartement d'Emmanuelle est un vrai appartement parisien plein de charme et décoré avec beaucoup de goût. La chambre est au calme sur la cour intérieure et mes parents y ont bien dormi ! Le quartier est un quartier sans trop de touristes mais proche du centre de Paris. ,2016-08-07T07:25:59Z,5
2039764,5597106,Stépha Et Jean-Loïc,"Emmanuelle nous a patiemment guidé, soit par mail/sms, soit par l'intermédiaire de sa gentille voisine. Son appartement est un petit havre de paix très confortable et soigneusement décoré. Situé au coeur du quartier de Ledru Rollin. Métro à une minute à pied, plein de petits bars et restos très sympas, de commerces et de bonnes boulangeries...",2016-05-18T02:46:03Z,4
2039764,6167584,Florence,"Super organisation pour un très bel appartement très bien situé ; l'espace de vie est vraiment très agréable. On s'y sent bien!

2039764,45916929,Maxime,"L'appartement est parfaitement conforme à la description. Son emplacement présente un double intérêt. Très proche de l'hyper-centre aux hauts-lieux touristiques et en plein cœur d’un quartier très vivant : un super marché, des commerces en tous genres à deux pas, il y a une vraie vie de quartier, et c’est très agréable de découvrir cet aspect de Paris.

L’appartement en tant que tel est très fonctionnel, lumineux, il y a des ondes très positives, on s’y sent vraiment très bien, le quartier est calme, la literie très bonne.

Et les échanges avec Emmanuelle ont été excellents. Rien à redire, je recommande !

9344307,2382100,Sarah,"Florence was lovely and met me when I arrived to hand over keys and show me around.  She was very sweet and made me feel very comfortable. 

The apartment is cozy and the perfect size for a single person or couple (or two friends that will share a bed!).   

Its in a great location and felt perfectly safe coming home later in the evening. 

I'd definitely stay there again! ",2016-09-12T06:20:59Z,5
9344307,26677207,Ethan,Florence's apartment was a charming and comfortable weekend getaway in Strasbourg  Saint-Denis and I would highly recommend for anyone considering visiting Paris. Everything in the apartment was neat and tidy with plenty of space and accommodations for two people as well as a plush and comfortable bed.

20893377,12476478,Noel,"A very sweet and stylish studio a good ways up in Ménilmontant. If you want to be in a residential neighborhood in Paris, it's good. If you want quick access to the Metro and to tourist areas this may not be the best place for you. It takes about ten minutes to walk to the nearest Metro, Telegraphe, and then you've got at least 10-15 minutes in the Metro to get to Chatelet, for example.",2018-11-04T15:55:28Z,5

33260897,154132763,Jessica,"This was easily one of the best Airbnb’s I have ever stayed in. From the very beginning they were very communicative in trying to get all of our trip details down to ensure that we were well taken care of during our stay. They always responded very quickly and made sure we had everything we needed to know. They gave us several suggestions for bakeries, bars, restaurants, etc. Their flat is amazing and so very cozy it really felt like we were coming home every night after a busy day in Paris. It was also very clean and well decorated which is something that was important to us while we were looking for accommodation. It’s in a beautiful and quiet  neighborhood that’s just a few minutes from the metro so it was still very accessible to everywhere we wanted to see. Staying here was a major reason as to why we loved Paris so much!!",2019-05-26T13:31:33Z,5
33260897,10609728,Erin,"Romain est un hôte parfait. Il nous a chaleureusement accueilli un peu avant l'heure du check-in afin de nous laisser déposer nos sacs. Quand nous sommes arrivés, il nous a aussi offert du café et des pâtisseries comme il était l'heure du petit-déjeuner. Très gentil! Son appartement est joli, propre, confortable et dans un quartier sympa et sans aucun bruit jour ou nuit. Beaucoup de lumière le matin et jolie vue d'autres immeubles typiquement parisiens.  : )
Le métro n'est pas loin (ligne 12) et il y a aussi un tramway qui vous amène au RER C (parfait pour notre visite à Versailles).

3476494,91454848,Grace,Anh Thy was a great host. Her home is very inviting. It was in a good central location. She was very thorough with all the directions for the house. This home is family friendly. There is a crib in the bedroom and a play area in the livingroom that is not shown in the photos. If you have a small child this would be perfect for you. Loved staying in her home and loved the pastries Anh Thy provide. Great place for family of 3 with small child to stay,2018-01-01T15:51:47Z,4
3476494,2056512,Holly,"We loved staying at Anh's spacious apartment! She was very welcoming and did so much to get the space ready for our stay. We had access to internet. She stocked essentials like shampoo, and basic cooking supplies, and laundry soap. She provided an excellent fan for the unexpected heat wave, for which we were very grateful.

The bed was very comfortable and the neighborhood was so convenient: close to two Metro stops, not far from Gare Montparnasse, and in our favorite arrondisement. 

We highly recommend a stay here!",2015-07-16T12:14:05Z,5
3476494,165737915,Karen,"This apartment is fantastic. It was clean and tidy and everything was as advertised. Anh Thy's willingness to  allow early collection of the key was really appreciated and the lovely breakfast foods, milk and wine were a nice added touch. The neighbourhood was extremely safe and the apartment is so close to metro stations, local shops, bellangeries  and cafes. Seeing the sights of Paris was so easy from this apartment.

5253795,34309341,Theresa,Gaelle apartment was clean and located near some very good and inexpensive restaurants. It's just an easy subway ride into Paris.  ,2015-06-23T13:52:02Z,4
5253795,64914450,David,"(Texte en Français plus loin) Perfect apartment for a great stay in Paris. I stayed at Gaelle's apartment for 5 weeks and loved my experience. It is fully equipped with everything you need: shower, washing machine, dishwasher, fully-equipped kitchen, etc. Perfect if you are staying for a while. Gaëlle is very friendly and has given us a full explanation on our first day, and she is always responsive and ready to help if there is anything during the whole stay. The location is also great, it's more quiet than anywhere else in town and it is not a tourist area, so the restaurants and shops nearby are very affordable compared to what you will find in tourist areas. The metro station is about a 3 minutes walk from the apartment and it will take you to the centre if town in less than 10 minutes. I recommend this place highly! //// Superbe appartement à Paris! J'y suis resté 5 semaines et j'ai adoré mon expérience. L'appartement est équipé de tout ce que vous avez besoin : douche, lave-linge, Lave-vaisselle, cuisine tout-équipée, etc. ce qui est parfait si vous y êtes pour un séjour prolongé. Gaëlle est une superbe hôtesse. La première journée elle a pris le temps de nous faire un tour complet de l'appartement en expliquant tout ce que l'on avait besoin de savoir autant sur l'appartement que sur le quartier. De plus, elle est toujours disponible s'il y a quoi que ce soit durant le séjour. J'ai énormément apprécié le quartier dans lequel l'appartement est situé. Il est un peu en dehors du centre-ville, ce qui en fait un endroit moins fréquenté par les touristes. Les restaurants et les commerces y sont donc beaucoup moins chers. Toutefois, la station de métro est à environ 3 minutes de marche et vous emmène au centre-ville en moins de 10 minutes. Je recommande cet appartement très fortement!",2016-07-03T03:53:49Z,5
5253795,57911923,Kels,"My room mate and I had a great experience at this apartment. We stayed here for one month, and didn't have a single problem. The building is safe, friendly, and clean.

5253795,15207472,Claudio,"Gaelle is a really nice Host, she was waiting for us in the flat and she was really kind in giving us all the information abuot the flat.",2016-01-05T13:23:23Z,4
5253795,783325,Adina,"Communication and check-in with Gaelle was great - she was thorough in giving us instructions for her apartment, and patient with our fluctuating arrival time. The place is small, but is cosy for two people. It is heavily decorated with interesting art and nice color schemes - there is not much counter space to put your things, although Gaelle made space in her closets for clothes and such. The bed is comfortable, the internet is fast. 

The apartment appears clean on the surface, but actually it is not so clean - dirty carpet in the living room, and in the kitchen: dirty shelves, drawers, dishes and cutlery with spots of food, dingy pots and pans(they were rusty!). I spent almost two hours cleaning on the first day, plus had to clean the vacuum cleaner first so that I could use it. We are not at all clean freaks, by the way. But as we were there for 9 days, I was expecting to be able to cook some meals, but the state of the kitchen made this very unappealing. 

It was starting to get cold outside, and unfortunately the heater was not working...so the apartment got quite cold on some nights. The towel heater in the bathroom works, but is not enough to heat the whole place. It was nice to have a clothes washer, but be aware, it takes a long time - it seems to be an older model.

Location is great! Very close to bus 26 which brings you directly to Gare du Nord - perfect for Charles de Gaulle airport connections. Also the metro Jourdain is a 5 minute walk away. Two beautiful parks at your fingertips - Buttes Chaumont, and Belleville - its a great place to be. Also, there is a small grocery store opposite the apartment - very handy!

Having an elevator is a plus, and it was an amazingly quiet one too - couldn't hear it at all even though is it right outside of the apartment. Being on the second floor means it is noisy from the street traffic, but that dies down from around midnight to 7am...

All in all, we had a good stay, but were dismayed by the state of the cleanliness in the kitchen. Not the best value, in our opinion.",2015-09-30T15:02:14Z,3

5253795,7248011,Marta,We had a nice staying at Gaelle's flat. The studio is perfect for a couple who wants to visit the city. Just few minutes from bus stop and metro.

7317338,3515666,Kevin,Sebastien was a great host. He was extremely helpful in orchestrating out travels from the train station to the apartment as this was our first ever trip to Paris. The property is exactly what we were looking for and was in a perfect part of town. It was quaint and could be made very quiet at night as there were quality sound proof windows. Our stay was perfect and we will try to stay here again on any future trip to Paris.,2016-07-16T00:32:47Z,5
7317338,31017306,Erin,"My husband and I had a great stay. While we did not meet Sébastien, he was responsive and provided detailed instructions on how to get into the flat, which was clean, spacious and well appointed. We loved the location, close enough to everything, with numerous shops and restaurants nearby, but far enough from the hustle and bustle to be quiet at night. I would recommend Sébastien's place to anyone looking for a place to stay a little off the beaten path. ",2016-07-01T07:16:27Z,5

7317338,96587476,Milan,"Fantastic apartment and a great way to experience the Paris lifestyle. Very comfortable and cozy with all the necessities included to make your stay an enjoyable one. I've been in quite a few hotels in my lifetime and this apartment is close to the top of the list. It was very clean, neat and tidy. 

A great location that was walking distance to everything that we wanted to see. I must say walking the streets of Paris and taking in the atmosphere was just awesome, especially in this neighbourhood. The apartment is also close to every means of transport if you need it.

Due to the excellent WiFi internet, I was able to research and plan each day perfectly.

Our host provided very good information about getting to and from the airport.

Thank you Sebastien. We had a great introduction to Paris.",2016-10-14T06:43:17Z,5

7317338,50433876,Steve,"This is a superb area to stay in. We walked everywhere from here. The only time we used the metro was to go up to Montmartre. We never came across an area - apart from  Île Saint-Louis that is, where we thought we would prefer to be based. A whole array of local artisan food shops to hand to suit all budgets and then ofcourse the rather expensive but excellent Le Bon Marché Rive Gauche with its grande epicerie de Paris  500m away on Rue de Sèvres. Sébastien is very laissez-faire, if you don't need him he's not there and if you do you just need to text, phone or email him. The road is a little noisy in the morning but the double glazing blocks it out; if you like fresh air there are some smaller back windows you can open.  Overall a very easy, comfortable and enjoyable stay. ",2016-08-21T08:12:37Z,4
7317338,50918523,Becky,"Wonderful apartment and very secure.  In a quiet road so away from the main hustle and bustle. 

A big recommendation for other travellers is to buy your food from the grand L'epicurie gourmand down the next road  (4 minute walk). They have a HUGE selection of fine foods including bread, cold meats/pates, cheese and fish to name a few. Plus a huge selection of fine wines. No one does good quite like the French.

7317338,43578820,Wayne,"Loved Sébastien's appartment! As an Australian couple and our 4th visit to Paris this appartment has been the best experience and as close to the Paris you see in the films without the hordes of tourists.  The photos are accurate and it was wonderful having a bright, airy living room with a lounge overlooking the street. This was a last minute change of plan for us but Sébastien was incredibly quick to respond and so there were no dramas and it couldn't have gone more smoothly if we had booked weeks in advance. The neighbourhood is vibrant but the street is very quiet at night so no problems with sleeping or noise, but all the upside of wonderful restaurants and brasseries in the street. And the cake shop Mamie Gateaux just 3 doors away was heaven! Luxemburg Gardens are an easy walk and we even walked to Musée D'Orsay comfortably. We only stayed 4 nights on this trip but Sébastien's appartment would be suitable for a long term stay as well. Just the one flight of stairs and no elevator, but the stairs are wide and easy to navigate. Wifi worked well and no problem with connection. Definitely stay here again when we are in Paris and the neighborhood/street is by far the most we have enjoyed of the times we have been in Paris. Thankyou Sébastien.",2015-11-03T15:06:18Z,5

Nos dejo una lista recomendando  restaurantes y bares del barrio o de otros sectores de Paris.  Estuvo muy pendiente de cualquier inquietud nuestra a travez de Dolores que es la persona que le ayuda con todas las cosas del apartamento.

El barrio donde esta localizado el apartamento creo que es de los mejores de Paris,  Saint Germain, donde esta se encuentran muchos restaurantes, tiendas y varias estaciones del metro.  Es un placer caminar por  este barrio debido a su historia , arquitectura y las personas que lo habitan.

La descripción que Sebastien hace del apartamento es fiel a lo que uno encuentra,  es cómodo y los muebles que tiene son sencillos pero buenos.  La cocina esta equipada con todo lo que uno necesita y los baños son pequeños pero funcionan bien.",2015-10-10T13:32:35Z,5

Le seul bémol concerne l'emplacement de la vaisselle et des ustensiles qui sont dans un meuble non fermé près du plancher, ce qui occasionne que la poussière se dépose sur la vaisselle et sur les ustensiles.

Cécile peut corriger cette lacune facilement.

Location is great, 3 min walking from metros, bus. There are a lot of bars and places to eat near, supermarkets and it is closely to Sacre Cour. 
The only complaint about the apartment is that it is a 4 floor (I know it before rent) - but is good  for exercising and all the buildings in Paris are like this one, and the shower is very small, but after a couple of day you use to it.
Definitely I would stay again if I would came back to Paris. Thanks Valerie!",2019-06-14T11:28:33Z,5

We had a warm welcome at the beginning, Valérie even organized a baguette for us as little snack. The appartment is nice for two adults, your reach the next metrostations Jules Joffrin and Marcadet-Poissoinniers in around 5 minutes by feet. The area around is inhabited by artists and students, it's livley and colourful, not touristic. There is a bakery across the street and many restaurants and bars nearby. We liked it very much and can easily imagine to return. Thank you Valérie!",2018-10-14T11:30:24Z,5
7015781,9138307,Milagros,"My husband, three year old and I stayed at Valerie's place for eight days. The apartment is walking distance to train station Joffin, and some restaurants/bars. However, it is wise to note that most food establishments are closed on Sundays and Mondays outside of the center of Paris. There is a supermarket, pizza hut, and wine shops nearby.

You have to walk up five flights on winding steps to get to the apartment which is on the 5th floor (Parisians refer to it as the 4th because they count the main floor as zero) The stairs are uncomfortable to walk up when carrying luggage, or if traveling with a child. There is no lift.

The bed is loft-like, and not safe for children. Neighbors are a little noisy at times so if you're looking to sleep in, forget it.

If you don't expect much, and aren't planning on staying indoors much, then for the price–it's ok. ",2015-10-18T17:23:14Z,1

The apt had SO MUCH character and charm, the exposed wood beams and little nooks not to mention the sky lights!! The entire space was filled with little sky lights and the living room was breathtaking with the sunlight streaming through the colored pains. Even listing to the rain pitter pattering on the glass, it was a perfectly romantic. We loved the stylish decor! and my personal favorite was the large bathtub tucked in the corner. 

The location was very convenient, right in Le Marais, walking distance to lots of cool bars (speakeasies), cafes, vintage shops and restaurants. Also near the Picasso Museum and Atelier Brancusi which I was dying to see. Definitely a hike up some stairs, she warned us and I was totally fine, figured it would be a good way to work off all the croissants I ate :) but I think my boyfriend counted 97 stairs haha so just know before booking.

This apartment has so much personality and is really fun to spend time in. It's a perfect place to relax after a day out. The bedroom is beautiful with the most incredible old wooden beams framing the space. 

We loved that the bathtub was tucked into a cozy corner of the bedroom. But there's also a separate shower/toilet room for those who want more privacy. The kitchen was stocked with all the important appliances, along with a great espresso machine. 

Stephanie's place is ideal for friends, couples or folks traveling alone. It's in the heart of the Marais, so as soon as you walk out the door, you're in the middle of a cool neighborhood with tons of bars, restaurants and shops.

21726168,7224037,Rael,"Stephanie's space in the heart of the Marais has a lot of character and is set in a fantastic location. 

She has clearly made enormous efforts to make her guests' stays as enjoyable as possible - from a very convenient check-in/out, to lovely little touches throughout the apartment. In particular, the beautiful living area with natural light and stylish decor feel very warm and welcoming. 

The location could also not be more convenient for those who enjoy the food, bars and shopping of the surrounding area. Stephanie is also a great communicator and was always very quick to respond - we really appreciated her hospitality. 

Two things to point out to guests are that the apartment is on the 5th floor with no lift so ensure you travel light. Also, the bedroom has a number of wooden beams in the ceiling that mean you need to watch your head - tall people should consider this! 

Otherwise, I would highly recommend Stephanie's apartment for those looking for a stylish space with lots of character in a very central Paris location.",2018-11-11T13:29:05Z,5

There are many stairs to get all the way to the top of the building and you would struggle a bit if you were too tall, but it suited us well for a few days.

He also recommended a great spot for dinner the first night. The place was larger than expected - a true one bedroom with separate living room and separate kitchen. The bed and pillows were comfy, and the shower is amazing. The location in Montmarte is very charming, close to the subway and the Sacre Coeur. You cannot hear the busy streets from the bedroom at night, but you can hear your neighbors if they are chatty in the hallway, Overall I'd say the space is quiet.

The neighbourhood  is relaxed and not that touristic. It is short walk to the centre of Montmartre. Parking is a problem but you can park in parking2000 for 15 euro a day.

3402015,20867420,Kelly,"Our first experience with Airbnb, and we couldn't have chosen a better host and location. Claire's description of her apartment was spot on, and she responded fairly quickly throughout the process. Immediately after greeting us, she made sure she showed us the door code, how to make coffee, turn on the tv and set up the couch/bed which we really appreciated, especially in our jet lagged state.

Shortly after that, Claire went above and beyond to make sure we knew about restaurants close by, including the best baguettes!, metro stops (her apartment is extremely close to two), and the sights of course. Sacré-Cœur is just five minutes away!

As far as Claire's apartment, it was exactly as pictured. We were comforted and charmed by it. As any vacation done right, we hardly spent time there when we weren't sleeping, but it was so nice to open the windows for breakfast and at the end of the day. It felt like a safe location as well.

We took a taxi to Claire's apartment when we landed at CDG, but it is also extremely easy to take the train back to the airport from the Pigalle station. Took us 45-60min in the early morning.

I would search for Claire's apartment for a return visit to Paris. It fit so well with our experience and settling in for so long. Claire's hospitality was icing on the cake!",2014-10-07T13:34:39Z,5

12662595,55116106,Nizam,"It's was great staying at Nicolas's place!

Fridge, freezer, washing machine, dishwasher, and oven! A large bed and a sofa bed in the living room. Wifi, Smart TV connected to Deezer, Bose speakers, and a Playstation with game disks! Chess, playing cards and backgammon!

We were rain bound one morning and was not bored at all. Perfect if you're bringing a teen with you. 

Great location that's near to metro and cafes, and a park literally at your doorstep.

The team that managed the apartment was very friendly,  and there was no problem with check in,  check out or communication.

Nicolas was a perfect host, and recommended an easy route out of Paris as we had to check out on Bastille day, where some metro stations are closed. 

Don't let the stairs deter you!",2017-07-14T12:55:07Z,5

There's a Velib bike station downstairs and lovely cafes and bars around the corner. 

Nicolas had an agency managing the house and they were excellent with communication and meeting us at the house (even after we were late with a flight delay.)

The house was is wonderfully equipped with everything you could need in the kitchen and lounge. Would highly recommend staying here!",2016-06-26T03:14:39Z,5

C'est pourtant la seconde fois que ce problème leur arrive. Si la poignée bloque, vérifiez bien que la chainette ne s'est pas décrochée ; le système est fragile.
Plus simple encore, demandez leur la clé qui permet d'ouvrir la porte à la place de la poignée. Il ne leur a pas paru judicieux de la donner, ni même la donner au gardien. 
(le concierge a ensuite cassé la clé dans la serrure en essayant de nous aider, mais c'est un autre problème...). 
Nous avons dû payer 3 fois plus que prévu au final.

Au départ arrangeants et sympathiques, ils sont devenus arrogants et malhonnêtes.

The apartment was beautifully decorated, and spotless. Bed incredibly comfortable in a cosy niche with a massive duvet! 

The 7 flights of stairs to the apartment did take some getting used to, however, it was worth it for the view of the Effiel Tower from the room, peace and sun beaming inside in the morning. 

I will certainly be staying again when travelling back for work.

Die Wohnung ist neu und modern eingerichtet. Perfekt für einen Paar-Kurzurlaub oder einen längeren Aufenthalt alleine. Die Wohnung ist klein, aber alles wichtige ist da und es ist sehr gemütlich. Vom Fenster sieht man in den Innenhof und sogar den oberen Teil des Eiffelturms.
Wichtig ist noch zu wissen, dass sie sich im 5. Stock ohne Aufzug befindet, für dynamische Menschen sollte das aber kein Problem sein.

Die Kommunikation mit Esther war zu jeder Zeit unkompliziert und sie ist auch auf persönliche Wünsche eingegangen. Danke dafür!

Die Lage der Wohnung ist sehr gut (17. Arrondissement) und ruhig, zwischen den Metrostationen 2 (Monceau) und 3 (Malesherbes). Supermarkt, Bäckerei und Apotheke sind in unmittelbarer Nähe. Außerdem braucht man nur 2 Minuten zum Park Monceau, der gerade bei schönem Wetter zum Joggen oder zum Entspannen im Grünen einlädt.

(It was great being close to things without the excessive level of noise from the street).  If you are able bodied enough to take 4 flights of narrow stairs in a renovated, yet charming building, then I highly recommend.  Building security is passcode protected and then once inside (before stairs) also key protected from a secondary door, something my girlfriend and I appreciated.  Excellent value.

Nearby has some marts to get some snacks/necessities, a bar and good food that is reasonably priced. 

The flat was really nice and cosy, very very comfortable for 2 people. Price wise it is really value for money. To get to his flat, it requires you to climb 4 flights of stairs which can be a hindrance if you're having big baggage. The ground floor is also protected via a passcode and is really safe.

The apartment itself is very spacious and has a really good feel to it - particularly enjoyed the luxury of having breakfast on the balcony in the morning. It's in a fantastic location, and a great base to explore the city - just a short walk from numerous metro stations. Ed was really helpful when it came to picking up the keys (despite us arriving late) and had some great recommendations in the local area to explore in the welcome book. Would definitely stay again.",2016-07-11T08:33:20Z,5
13135280,75863123,Keith,"Édouard was a great host. He waited patiently for us to arrive, even though traffic caused us to arrive a little later than expected. He showed us around the apartment and made us feel very welcome. The apartment was exactly as described and pictured on the website, and it was in an ideal location for exploring Paris. The neighborhood in Pigalle has everything you could need or want, including grocery stores, restaurants, bars, subway, and shopping areas. We would definitely consider this apartment again the next time we are visiting the City of Lights. ",2016-07-05T04:09:09Z,5

Chris and Bruno were both very kind and quick to respond, and she was very thorough in her explanation of how to get to the flat from the airport. She also left a detailed wonderful note about all of the amenities and let us use anything that was there. I was surprised that she also included an adapter for US outlets, which was extremely considerate. My husband and I stayed here for our anniversary and had a lovely stay. Would highly recommend staying here!",2017-11-30T12:11:12Z,5

Chris and Bruno were very conscientious, checked on me a few times, and responded to my questions very quickly. They were also available for advice and suggestions on Paris.

19444880,26930648,Jessa,"Chris' apartment is located in a perfect neighbourhood close to everything you'll want to visit, but far enough away that you'll feel like you're living as a Parisian rather than a tourist. Both she and Bruno were extremely helpful and quick to respond. Bruno went above and beyond to assist me (i.e. running over to help when I was struggling with the lock) - and Chris provided me with a great vegan bakery recommendation, and was always just a text message away. Both of them put my mind at ease when I left my wallet behind after checking out. I can't thank them enough for contributing so much to the quality of our first few days in France!",2017-11-21T14:47:43Z,5

Chris wohnt hier normalerweise, die Wohnung ist also bestens ausgestattet, viele hübsche Designer-Details. Die Küche ist eng (2 Herdplatten), aber völlig ausreichend.

25439485,72935121,Joy,"Sylvain was an excellent host and his Paris apartment felt like home! He even left me a few beers 😉

Communication: Fast and reliable! Sylvain made me feel comfortable.

Check In: I appreciate them waiting for me since I got lost. Directions were simple to follow from the airport, but I took the wrong metro haha

Value: His flat is huge for Paris standards! I’m coming from NYC so this was humongous for me! I love that there was laundry in the flat and separate rooms for the living spaces. Wifi is strong for WFH. It’s a real two bedroom flat. The guest room has a bunk bed and pull out mattress which could fit 4 people if you had someone sleep on the living room couch.

Location: Felt like a real local. This is in a young artistic area. It’s far enough away from the central area to not feel tourists but close enough to be walking distance to main attractions and metros! The flat faces a busy street but I don’t mind city noises.

Price: I felt the price was well marked for what you receive.",2022-07-23T14:21:37Z,5

Benjamine is such a polite and friendly host ever! He was willing to answer my questions and always replied me in 30 minutes. Once I had a problem
with the tv and the coffee machine, he came to the house and showed me how to figure it out, which impressed me a lot.

He showed and explained us everything about the flat and the neighbourhood. Moreover he asked us prior to our arrival what kind of wine we would like to have and he left a bottle of wine with corkscrew, glasses and cacahuètes on a tray, where we also found two cups with espresso capsules (there is an espresso machine).

The apartment itself is just perfect, quiet and cosy and super functional with a lot of light, a comfy bed, a superb desk if you want to write or work and everything you need to cook if you fancy it. The building itself is super nice and the street it is in is quiet and yet literally a stone throw away from a lively neighbourhood, lots of shops, public transport, cafés, bakeries, bookstores, delis, supermarkets... anything you need really! The gorgeous Buttes Chaumont park is a 5 minutes walk from the apartment and the best swimming pool in Paris is 10 minutes away across the loveliest pedestrian alleys of Paris.

And one fast bus ride from Gâre du Nord Eurostar terminal.

Stéphanie is a charming and helpful host. She met me personally and explained everything in the flat, as well as giving me advice on local facilities. She also arranged for a neighbour to know about me in case I needed additional back up. All communication was prompt and very helpful.

21159204,2643065,Daniel,"Stéphanie's place was wonderful. It is on the fourth floor of a building at the back of a little courtyard, so set back from the street and therefore free of any street noise. It is in a wonderful area of Paris -- Belleville -- steps away in one direction from one of the nicest parks in Paris, les Buttes Chaumont, and in the other direction from Rue de Belleville, a pleasing hodgepodge of old local and more hipster restaurant and shops. Down the road are some of the best Chinese restaurants in Paris.
The place itself is great -- basically two medium-sized rooms, one serving as living and dining area, and the other as bedroom and study. Both are very tastefully decorated and feel very homey. The bathroom seems to have been very recently renovated, and is therefore very nice and highly functional, not always the case in older Parisian buildings. The bed is super comfortable, and there is a very attractive desk at which to work.
Communication with Stéphanie was always prompt. Stéphanie was there to meet me when I got to the apartment, and she gave me a very thorough tour and left clear detailed explanations for everything.

The room was exactly as described, in a great location (15 min walk from the eiffel tower) and right outside metro stations. Getting to the apartment from the airport was also super easy. The kitchen was equipped with all the essentials + more, the shower was great pressure and temperature and the bed was extremely comfortable. We were very happy. One of our best airbnb experiences yet !
Thanks Arthur. ",2016-09-06T10:32:01Z,5

28405703,39750866,Brook,This is a wonderful and cozy flat on the 3rd floor of a lovely building on the edge of Pigalle and Montmartre.  Two Metro stops are nearby and also a number of great restaurants.  Walking to Montmartre & Sacre Coeur is easy.  We much prefer this neighborhood to super touristy areas.  We loved Vrai Paris at the top of the hill for breakfast.  We especially appreciated Victoria’s flexibility with check-in as our flight arrived at 7am.  Would stay here again in a heartbeat.,2018-10-23T14:59:10Z,5

She provided us a print out of bus stops of the line, which was very helpful for the first couple of days as you are not familiar with the are.  Metro stop is less than 10 minutes away. A large supermarket is on her street less than 5 minutes away. Plus there are cafe, bars, and restaurants although we did not go.

The apartment is sparkling clean and perfectly laid out for two.  The communication before and during our stay was amazing. This was our first airbnb stay and we were a little nervous, so we really appreciated all the help from Alice and Maixence! Having the Rue de Martyrs nearby was a dream. Over the course of our stay we ubered and walked countless miles in Paris, but this little neighbourhood was our favourite by a longshot. Authentic shops and people, such beauty and the food!!! Popelini cream puffs! The best strawberries I have ever eaten from the market nearby. Wine! Cheese! The area has it all.

I found the space to be larger than I expected and very neat, clean and well-appointed. During my stay I made extensive use of the kitchen (there are many fine places to buy excellent produce nearby) and enjoyed using the Sonos speaker to stream music via wifi, which was functional throughout my stay. I found the bed to be very comfortable and enjoyed many hours of reading on the couch/sofa. The shower is huge and the bathroom is modern and roomy. I used the washing machine, dishwasher, microwave oven and coffee machine regularly and all worked faultlessly. The neighbours were both quiet and friendly and it was nice to be on the ground floor (no stairs). The courtyard and greenery outside the front door is something special. A short walk to basically any food/wine shop you could need, as well as the Cadet Metro. Alice was both friendly and informative in all correspondence and I would happily stay in her appartement again in the future.",2017-11-25T13:43:57Z,5

There was some construction going on around the building, but they started after I left in the morning and were done by the time I returned. Maixence was a lovely and charming host and is located close by if you have any problems. 

The only issues that I had were that there is no TV in the flat and the wireless internet is very slow (<3 Mbps download).

If insist, you can go to the attractions on foot.

The interior of the apartment is modern and cosy.  I never checked with Marguax but it seems newly renovated (don’t be fooled by the pictures, it is way better by what you see on the AirBnb pictures).

6091393,30884257,Eunhye,"It was great time staying in Margaux' home.
Even though I couldn't meet her face to face,
I could feel her sense of interior; modern, chic, and cozy.
The location is wonderful for sightseeing and having awesome lunch and dinner. Specially the restaurant of Hotel d' Amour, just in front of the house, it is a hot place to enjoy brunch. 
I've heard this area, 9em arrondissement, is post Marais, as a rising hip place, and i could see why this area is called like that. 
And this location is just the heart of it. 
While i stayed, I didn't have any inconvenience with anything else. The place is enough to stay for 2 people, (i was alone, though) , everything was set up, even Wi-fi was really fast. ",2015-07-04T13:05:10Z,5
6091393,35701787,Donna,"Margaux was a fantastic host. She responded to me very quickly in all communication, and was really helpful when my train was delayed.

The apartment has everything you need and it felt like a home from home. I would definitely recommend this apartment and the host.",2015-06-20T14:52:14Z,5
7805151,8748720,Vered,"we were their first airbnb guests and we had a fantastic experience. 
We have been using Airbnb for 7 years and this one was the best ever. 
I chose it because it was clear via the photos this is a real home with quality furniture. 
They welcomed us with open hearts and a big smile. Whatever was missing , they brought us the next day. the place was clean and neat and well equipped. The space is airy , full of light and very comfi. it has a very nice and useful porch. it is on the 6th floor with elevator . The place was renovated recently so all the appliances were in excellent condition. 
  The neighborhood is lively, metroFelix Faure (line 8) is 3 min  walk, metro line 10 is 12 min walk. plenty of busses: 70, 88, 80, 39, 42.
The Duplex farmer market is 13 min walk. it is a superb marche.around the corner, on Felix Faure you can find two of the best bakery in town.

10264798,6388524,Shannon,"We loved this flat for the location & beautiful morning light. When we travel, we love to experience the city as a local, and this was the perfect location for that. We could walk almost everywhere on our destination list (we are far more interested in restaurants, cafés, outdoor markets & parks to picnic at, rather than the Champs-Élysées, Eiffel Tower, and other main tourist attractions, these are further away but an easy metro ride). The flat has beautiful light, but does not have much space to hang out in, so it’s more of a “drop your bags and go” kind of flat. The shower is on a platform and awkwardly small, but we are small people so it worked fine for us. I would recommend for a 3-5 day stay in Paris if you are on a budget and want to be in the heart of the city.",2018-10-03T14:32:28Z,4
10264798,60688557,Sally,"Laëtitia and Cécile were very responsive in the time leading up to my trip and were happy to arrange a way for me to check-in early. Their place is cozy and very lovely. It is a small studio with a pull-out futon and might be cramped for more than 2 people, but my friend and I had no problem with that.

The subway station is just a few minutes away and whisks you right into the city within 10-15 minutes. There is also an outdoor market by the station that set up a few times during our stay, with vendors selling fresh produce, fish, cheese, and other artisanal goods. If you don't feel like taking the metro, within a 10-25 minute walk, you can be in the heart of Marsais or find yourself strolling along the romantic Seine River towards Notre Dame and the Louvre.

The only possible downside I can see is the flight of stairs up to the apartment. Like the description says, their place is located on the 6th floor and is definitely a long, healthy trek up and down the stairs. I particularly enjoyed the walk up and down, but it definitely took the wind out of me every time!

I highly recommend Laëtitia and Cécile's place for anyone's stay in Paris.",2018-09-24T14:16:59Z,5
10264798,103986673,Teri,"Cecile was a great host who went out of her way to make our stay enjoyable. She sent someone to hand-deliver our key because we were arriving late on Sunday. The location itself was superb, within walking distance to the Bastille Metro on the #1 line, a direct connection to all the major sights. The neighborhood is also filled with great, late-night restaurants and within walking distance to the Marais and extraordinary parks like the Place de Vosges. On Thursday, there's a great open-air market right around the block from the apartment. Try some of the handmade sausages by Fabian.",2018-05-24T11:05:21Z,5

10264798,1588854,Andrea,"Nice little apartment in Bastille, very close to line 1. Very cozy and under the roofs.
Keep in mind that the flat is on the 6th floor;  if you are ""not more"" young or a bit ""off shape"", it could be  a bit fatiguing. If you are like me (I am 50, but I live on 4th floor without elevator), all is fine.
There is everything in the flat for a short stay, all equipped, microwave, shower, tea and coffee...all nice and clean.
The flat is used by the owner, so keep it in mind (there a few cupboards locked for privacy), not everything could be used by guests, I think.
There is not TV (I have no TV in my home, so for me it's a plus!), but, in Paris, if you need TV to pass your days, there is something wrong with you!
Saturday evening is a bit noisy (but hey, Paris is Paris!) but on the 6th floor the noise is actually far, I slept well. The other days are perfectly fine. 
All considered, a nice stay.",2018-07-03T13:40:55Z,5

The apartment was very cute (just a little small by North American standards). Keep in mind that it is up six flights of stairs. But the exercise is good. The location was great. It is one block from a subway stop, but we also walked a lot, since it is still close to a lot of stuff. There is a great boulangerie just kitty corner to the apartment where we got fresh bread in the mornings. The Thursday/Sunday market, just outside the front door, was a delight!

Existe elevador para accesar al edificio y las rampas para discapacitados están en la entrada, aunque hay un ancho de ésta, reducido.
Los vecinos son tranquilos. Y el apartamento está cerca de estaciones de transporte público.

The street below is pedestrian and at night there is some noise from the bars but it didn’t bother us at all - we were either down there ourselves or way too tired for it to bother us. If you are a super light sleeper just bring earplugs. 

Katia has great advice on where to grab resell vintage/luxury bags if that’s your thing...she also gave amazing dining options. Check in & out was smooth and simple. We highly recommend her place and would stay there again in a heartbeat.",2019-10-18T16:49:54Z,5
3651257,97770994,Kirby,"Katia’s place is awesome! Located in a great spot, check in & check out was easy, & Katia was very easy to communicate with and quickly responded to our questions. She even gave us tips for local restaurants! There is some noise from the street below,  but we had no problems sleeping. The location offers a ton of choices for eating & going out. Go ahead and book this place!",2019-08-17T11:35:41Z,5
3651257,30265078,Sarah,We absolutely LOVED our stay in Katia’s apartment. It was such a terrific location (close to literally everywhere you need to be). We got in earlier than anticipated and Katia was so helpful when it came to checking in early considering it was at the last moment. She helped us with any questions we had and was extremely quick to respond! Would stay here again and again!,2019-07-20T14:45:24Z,5
3651257,75746507,Jennifer,"We couldn’t have picked a better location if we tried! Perfect spot, right in the heart of Paris, making everything easily accessible. Wonderful neighborhood with great restaurants. The apartment was fantastic, the perfect place for us to relax and enjoy a bottle of wine with the windows open, listening to the crowd below. Yes, there is some street noise into the evening (as was expected based on the description) but it didn’t interfere with our stay in anyway. Would absolutely stay again!",2019-07-11T13:57:12Z,5
3651257,11764180,Madi,"We had a lovely stay at Katia’s place! The location is perfect and there is so much to do in the area, it’s hard to leave! Her space is up one flight of stairs, in a password protected building. It’s on a pedestrian street that can get pretty wild at night so be prepared for noise on weekends! Nothing earplugs can’t block out though. The space is functional and roomy, and it’s obvious that this is Katia’s home and not just a vacation rental. It’s very stylish and chic, with cute personal touches that make it seem like you are staying with a friend. We loved this apartment and would recommend to all! Thanks Katia!",2019-06-01T13:11:37Z,5
3651257,54124687,Avery,"Katia's little apartment was charming, cozy, and filled with light. Katia left little welcoming touches like a bottle of wine and note welcoming us. We stayed here (my wife, myself, and our twin infants) and it was the perfect amount of space for us. also, only a tiny bit of stairs to climb. The apartment was clean, functional and in the best part of the neighborhood (bakery, bookstore, and four different grocery stores in a 30 second radius). It is a 13 walk to the Louvre and close to public transportation. Definitely bring a sound machine - people are loud and out into the mourning hours - our sound machine saved us! It was fun to people watch from the large windows!",2019-02-19T14:08:01Z,5
3651257,104219386,Gabs,"Katias place is a must stay, you’ll have everything you need! I felt like I was right at home as soon as we walked in and she provided great recommendations, will stay again next time we are in town.",2018-11-25T15:08:35Z,5
3651257,76370905,Violetta,"A lovely, comfortable, and immaculately clean apartment, in the center of a very busy area. Perfect French bakery, and other food stores, very close by, including a super market. Restaurants all around, easy walks to many attractions. Le Marais is a bohemian quarter, where fun continues into the night. The noice on the small street does not stop until the small hours of the morning, especially on the weekends. We used head phones and ear plugs. The apartment is small but the location makes up for it many times over. Katia is very attentive, easy to reach, and all around a great host. We had a great time.",2018-10-31T13:19:14Z,5
3651257,101289798,Richard,“We had a lovely time. I especially loved the decor and her obvious love of fashion. The collection of shoes was quite impressive! We felt very welcome and the bottle of wine was a nice touch! Surprisingly we didn’t finish it since we were gone from the apartment so much of the time. We would surely recommend this place and Katia as our host”. Written by Colleen,2018-10-13T11:08:55Z,5

3651257,169553795,Madeline,"Katia’s is a quintessential Parisian flat in a very au courant neighborhood, full of life and energy. Small but cute and comfortable, it is perfect for two. It is close to the river, the metro, Stravinsky Square, Pompidou Modern Art Museum and is deep in the heart of a newly hip area. It is noisy late into the night, but nothing silicone drop earplugs and turning the fan on low doesn’t block out. We loved it and would definitely return and we are in our late 60’s...and young at heart!❤️",2018-09-16T14:33:44Z,5
3651257,102437103,Chris,"Katia was a wonderful host, and her place is clean and just like the pictures.  The location is  perfect for getting anywhere you need, whether by walking or by train.  The apartment is steps away from many restaurants and bars which makes it very convenient but can also be noisy thru the night/sleep.  (my stay was over the weekend, so can't speak to weekdays).  Other than the unexpected night noise which can be fixed by using earplugs, it was a perfect stay!",2018-08-26T11:15:22Z,5

3651257,27725035,Alyssa,"Katia’s apartment is in the perfect location. A 15 minute walk to Notre-dame or the Lovre, 2 min walk to the closest metro station, and less than 2 mins to a lovely boulangerie. 

We loved coming back, opening the windows and listening to the nightlife outside. Which we were concerned about before booking but the bars turn the music down low around 11pm so sleeping was never a struggle.

Thank you for sharing your space Katia :) it made our time in Paris very memorable.

Inside the flat there's everything you need, and even in the hottest days it wasn't so hot.

The appartement is spacious, modern and well-equipped, a lot of mirrors tough :-) eveything you need and more. cosy and modern so we had our little cosy home in the heart of the city.

The bathroom is nice and the shower perfect for a shower for two. The only annoying thing was the sink, which needs to be cleaned until it is dry after every wash to avoid stains. 
The flat is located very well, there are many bars, restaurants and shops around there and the next metro station is close, too. 
We had a super great time in your flat and would come back again.

Værten var meget gæstfri og hjælpsom. 
Hun var nem at komme i kontakt med og stod på gaden ved ved opgangen og tog imod.

1549177,261186095,John,"My wife and I stayed for a week at Julien’s place in Paris and it was fantastic. It’s off a quiet street and close to two metro stops. If you plan to use the metro it’s very easy to get to most of Paris in a half-hour or less. The check in and check out were easy. The whole apartment was clean and cozy with all the amenities we needed. Julien was a fantastic host, checked in to make sure arrival was smooth and even left some champagne, beer and coffee as a welcome gift. Highly recommend staying here.",2023-10-29T12:53:39Z,5
1549177,51537523,Fahad,"Julien is a great host, always responsive. I really liked the place, it is close to a couple of metro stops that can take you to all the places in Paris you might want to visit. There is decent space in the apartment and it is well equipped and stylish. I’d stay here again.",2023-10-08T11:53:25Z,5
1549177,454606345,John Howard,"We had a great stay at Julien's apartment. He was there to meet us and get us settled in.  He was always available by text to answer all our questions. The apartment had everything we needed, was clean and was just as described on airbnb.  The bed was very comfortable too.  We were in a typical neighborhood with restaurants, a grocery store just steps away and typical bistros.  We felt like Parisians. 
2 metros were a 10 minute walk away and most destinations were 20-30 minutes away. A world class patisserie was one block away so breakfast or sandwiches were covered.  I would stay there again",2023-09-13T14:13:41Z,5
1549177,73573106,Savannah,Julien’s apartment is picture perfect! We had a great stay and we’re very comfortable in his stylish space. He was quick to respond to any questions we had and we loved his recommendations for bars and restaurants in the area. The neighborhood is super walkable and a quick stroll to the metro can get you anywhere in 20-40 mins. We worked from the apartment while there and the internet was great. Would definitely stay there again!,2022-07-16T11:53:06Z,5

If you want to see the tourist attractions, there are two metro stops very close and it’s a fast trip to the center of Paris.

Julien is quick to respond and very helpful. He made everything so easy for us. Next time we come to Paris we will definitely stay at Julien’s again.",2022-05-22T14:45:13Z,5

The apartment is beautifully and thoughtfully furnished. It has everything (and more)  for a great stay. Another reviewer mentioned the shower had great water pressure—true!

Neighborhood had loads of restaurants, stores, etc. Perfect jog to Sacré Coeur and Montmartre.  A lovely local park w very cute cafes/ shops nearby. 

Metro very close to apartment, lots of bus options as well. Excellent, award winning bakery nearby. Pass Sanitaire/ return Covid test handled quickly by pharmacy just steps away from apartment. 

Hope to stay there again!",2022-01-13T15:10:46Z,5
1549177,356813413,Sara,"Julien's place is wonderful! Decorated eclectically and fun, we enjoyed spending our down time sitting with the windows open and having friends over for a glass or two in the spacious living room.  There is no AC or elevator to the third floor where the flat is, but the charm of the architecture makes it totally worth it. We preferred to enjoy local cafes and dining, so the small kitchen didn't bother us. The shower has awesome water pressure and shower head, a definite bonus!

As American tourists visiting Paris, this flat was a little far from where we spent our time. The metro stop was a short walk and scooters available down the street which made transportation very accessible. We enjoyed local cafes and restaurants in the neighborhood, and hearing the school children each morning down the street :) In the future, we would probably choose somewhere a little more central.

Julien is an excellent host, communicating with you before, during, and after your stay. He is friendly and inviting, as is his home.",2021-09-12T12:04:09Z,5
1549177,18042213,Jamie,"My husband and I stayed at Julien's place for 5 weeks and it was fantastic. The bed was comfy, the couch was comfy, the kitchen had everything one would need.

He responded quickly to any questions and concerns.",2019-11-01T15:05:53Z,5
1549177,17322964,Sarah,"The apartment is, as advertised, stylish, with ample space and reliable WiFi.  I was looking for a place where I could feel at home (and get some work done) after some sightseeing and this fit the bill.   AirBnBs can, sometimes, feel incredibly impersonal.  This was quite the opposite and I appreciated that.

There are also many great shops (and parks) in the area.  Batignolles is a great neighborhood ... safe and friendly.  The only downside to the neighborhood is taking the 13 line of the Metro (both of the nearby stops are on that line.). It was at  times miserably crowded!  But, both stops are right near the apartment.  Julien is a thoughtful host,  responsive, and accommodating.",2019-09-20T13:56:33Z,5

It is well situated next to Montmartre for easy walking access, and also to the metro for access around town. The apartment itself is quirky and Julien has a very cool style. The bed is comfortable. There is a lot of room and you have everything you could need. Julien was very responsive and great at communication - I highly recommend staying there!",2019-01-19T15:46:04Z,5

12339700,71896977,Gina,Our host Lingzhen was excellent at communicating with us throughout our stay. She provided great information and we arrived quickly to the flat after flying into the airport. Great location to all popular sights and other hidden gems.  Gorgeous apartment. Very comfortable for our family of four. We really enjoyed having a balcony and fans helped on the warmer evenings.  When we return to Paris we would definitely stay here again.,2016-07-12T11:55:53Z,5

12339700,17440936,Mark,"We had a one night stopover with our 2 young children. Lingzhen was extremely quick in replying to our messages and very flexible - we changed our time of arrival twice and had a late check-out, both no problem! The apartment is in a good location - short walk to Jardins du Lux., metros & essential shopping. It looked just as it did on photos - perfect for a couple but perhaps a squeeze for a family staying for a longer break. My only criticism is that it needed a better clean - some dust & hairs need vacuuming, floors a wash etc. Bedlinen was fine though. ",2016-07-18T10:09:06Z,4
12339700,737742,Trisha,"Lingzhen met us at the apartment when we arrived & showed us a few things. The pictures are accurate. The apartment is bright, modern & comfortable. The stairway leading up to the second floor is dark & musty smelling, but honestly it added to the old city feel!  But the appartment itself is newly renovated. It was quite hot out (about 25 degrees) and the apartment was very hot at night!  We couldn't leave the windows open all night because of the traffic noise below (not terrible, but enough to wake you up). Lingzhen immediately bought two fans, which helped a great deal. The neighbourhood feels safe & welcoming. It is very close to the Luxembourg RER station, making it very easy to get virtually anywhere in Paris. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here & would book it again without a second thought. Highly recommended. ",2016-06-26T02:10:28Z,4

12339700,8354395,Amanda,"Lingzhen welcomed us and showed us the amazing apartment! We loved it so much. It was so spacious, clean and had everything you could want. We stayed for 10 nights so for us we needed a kitchen and the kitchen here was amazing with hotplates, oven, dishwasher which was really nice to stay in Paris and be able to buy some of the incredible produce we found at the markets and take it home for dinner! The neighbourhood was one with a much more local feel which was so close to the pretty Luxembourg gardens and train station   too. We love walking and found you could see some really cute streets and surrounding Arrondissements too like St. Germain and Marais District. We have been to Paris before, but this was our favourite location and accommodation. I would highly recommend this apartment to anyone, Beautiful. ",2016-05-29T10:25:34Z,5

The mattress was super comfortable, and a real mattress (not a futon mattress), which I appreciated as a tourist who spent all day walking. It's also very close to several metro stops, breakfast places (including Odette and Aime at the bottom of the building) in addition to a grocery store. All of which made our mornings very convenient. There are bars and night life around, but none so close or loud that it disturbed our sleep at all. There are also some really wonderful restaurants around including Verre & Chope which I highly recommend! Overall we had an excellent stay, Thibault is a wonderful and accommodating host.

The apartment is very easy walking distance from 2 metro stations, grocery is across the street and the restaurant downstairs is very good.   The neighbor hood has all you need and we were able to explore all of Paris with great ease from this location.  HIGHLY recommended!  ",2017-04-11T08:52:32Z,5
3036502,18844588,Andrea,I can't tell you enough how great the location is! You're 15-20 minutes maximum from the main touristic attractions. But a majority are a lot closer. The metro is a short 5 minute walk and there's a convenient bus stop across the street. I was extremely surprised with how accessible everything was from this Airbnb. This apartment is suitable for one person or two people that don't mind giving up their privacy since the apartment is not that large in size. Thibault is a very accommodating host and I'm so grateful for his attentiveness whenever we needed him! Thank you!,2017-03-25T08:09:10Z,4

He just had a brand-new shower put in, which is a phenomenal upgrade. While the apartment is on what Americans would call the 7th floor, fear not: only one flight of stairs thanks to an elevator to the 6th. The apartment is well laid out and furnished. And being on the top floor, the windows open wide to scenic Parisian boulevards and skies. What more could you want?",2017-02-24T10:54:44Z,5
3036502,91731331,Shanshan,"Thibault's place literally has everything you will need for your stay, from clean towels, cable TV to coffee maker. The studio is located right above a cafe, across the street from a carrefour, and near numerous bakeries, restaurants, and most importantly, the metro. Also, the studio is actually what we call a ""junior 1 bedroom"", with the bed located in a separate room from the dining and living area. Better yet, for those of you who, like me, visit Paris with great trepidation due to the lack of any French ability, do not worry, as Thibault speaks fluent English and will answer any questions you may have. Solid five star. ",2017-01-06T07:48:26Z,5

The place had a nice restaurant in the same building - ground/first floor, a supermarket right on another side of the road, a mobile shop to buy any local prepaid SIM card, and many more places to make stay smoother.

Thibault  - the host was very nice. He came down to pick up me and helped me check-in and get easy. I was having some issue with local telecom company SFR and he helped with that also.

He has clearly thought through the needs of all of his guests in having all the standard items one would expect in a hotel and more. The views from the windows were amazing and the place excellent for the three days we stayed. It was also nice to be close to major transit options but not smack dab in the middle of all the tourist attractions.

Guillaume was very quick to respond to communications and questions prior to our arrival. He was accommodating to our arrival time and personally came to give us the introduction to the flat.
Location of flat is perfect. Away from tourist crowds but just steps to bus and metro for easy access to all that Paris has to offer. Also walking distance to many amenities such as restaurants, bakeries and outdoor markets.
The flat is exactly as the photos.  Very bright and spacious. Comfortable bed and fully equipped kitchen. 
We visit Paris on a regular basis and this flat will be at the top of our list.

Cafes and restaurants are nearby as well as all kinds of shops for the everyday needs. The Butte aux Cailles (a 15 min walk) offers a gerat choice of bubbly bars and restaurants. All in all, I recommend Guilaume's place wholeheartedly to everybody who loves Paris (or who wants to learn to know  Paris).",2018-05-26T12:22:03Z,5
11233593,60093639,Hans-Peter,"We have encountered a very friendly welcome. A little welcome paper had been really useful, giving all the informations needed by a guest, especially when new to Paris. The appartment looked exactly like the photos, very spacious, with much light from the big windows.  We liked the well equipped kitchen very much because it gave us the freedom of choice between a restaurant visit or cooking by ourselves (which we did). This is the general advantage of an appartment over a hotel room - if it rains (and sometimes it does rain  even in Paris) you can stay in the appartment and feel comfortably at home. The bedroom is spacious, too, and the king-size bed has room enough for two (even without disturbing each other,  if that may be necessary). By the way, bed clothes and towels are provided and you don't have to care for the final cleaning. The TV in the living room has access to at least 500 international programs, which comes very handy if you want to stay connected to news from your home country. Highspeed WLAN is also available. A maybe important feature for those who have security issues against Paris: The appartment can only be reached via a metal-grilled entrance, which is always closed and supervised by a concierge. From the balcony you have a marvellous view of Paris, from Montparnasse to Pantheon. The street looks beautiful from above, with so many trees.  Most people don't think of a green Paris! 

We have to admit that we do know the quarter since many years really well. It is charming, a wonderful mix of all kinds of people. The Butte aux Caille can be easily reached by a little walk - there are lots of bars, cafes, restaurants for every taste. It's something of an in-quarter, too. The Jardin du Luxembourg is near, also the Jardin des Plantes. For those who want to discover whole Paris the nearby Place d'Italie gives access to three Metro-lines, the fastest way to go whereever you want, e.g. it takes only 30 minutes to the Eiffel tower. For the gourmet fraction there are markets with really fresh products. Of course you could also visit supermarkets or bakeries or butcher shops and a french specialty: The so-called traiteurs with their luxurious convenience food.

All in all, it has been our most pleasant visit to Paris in the last years. We would recommend an accommodation like this to anyone who loves Paris (and who does not!). We are sure to be there next year again. Thanks to Guillaume!",2016-05-30T03:24:08Z,5

It is a quick 20 min metro ride to the major attractions and there are several restaurants and grocery stores nearby. The apartment is spacious and comfortable with the only small space being the toilet. I am a large guy, about 6ft 1 in and it was a tight fit but that's European living for you.

The place is exactly as you see in the photos.  It's a smaller studio, but artfully designed.  It was a little colder for me because of the time of year/marble, but overall warm enough.  
Charles was super responsive and helpful- he came by within 1-2 hours when the wi-fi stopped working temporarily, and also helped me with my check-out time.  Great host and place.",2017-11-17T13:59:08Z,4

20531222,4542842,James,"The location is perfect for staying in Le Marais. You are right in the middle with lots of trendy shops, bars, cafe and places to eat. 

Just as the pictures, the room is small. Fine for one person and ok for two if you are ok with confined spaces. The central heating was great (was snowing while we stayed), but room was very warm. One wall looked like it was being treated for mould, but no smell so fine. Just needed to be painted white to match the rest of the flat. 

The flat is up two floors of stairs with no lift. This added to the character of the building, but bare-in-mind if lots of luggage or trouble with stairs.

There is a small fridge (extremely cold), plates, cutlery to use. A plug in stove if needed, but I would suggest if you need a kitchen while staying, this flat is not the one. There are great places to eat in the area, bring money as all very expensive. 

My only negative is the temperature of the shower water if you like a warm/hot shower. The water got warm for a quick dash in the shower. 

Tips for the area; Le Perla bar for the fashion crowd and good priced drinks, La Pick Clops for food. Wine at La Belle Hortense. Morning pastries and sandwiches (have breakfast here too) Boulangerie de Rennes... Delicious!",2018-03-19T12:40:09Z,4

33873477,144261007,Emilien,"Tout s'est merveilleusement bien passé. Arrivant un peu plus tard que prévu initialement, Paola a eu un chargée une amie de m'accueillir et me remettre les clés.
L'appartement est particulièrement chaleureux avec un côté vintage dans la déco qui m'a séduit. Il est donc convivial et surtout très fonctionnel. On y trouve vraiment tout le nécessaire (depuis la cuisine jusqu'à la salle de bain) et pas uniquement les basics comme dans la plupart des hébergements. Je craignais le bruit de la rue étant en rez-de-chaussée mais il n'en fut rien. C'est très calme (et pourtant à 3min à pied seulement du M° Belleville). Avoir une cour privée en centre-ville était très plaisant durant un week-end de canicule. 
Lors de mes prochaines escapades à Paris, je vérifierai si cette offre est toujours disponible. Je recommande fortement ce logement.",2019-07-01T12:10:33Z,5

There were restaurants, boulangeries and a small supermarket all in close proximity, as well as several metro stations. The apartment was clean, tidy and surprisingly spacious. It overlooks a courtyard, making it a quiet place to stay.

The apartment was quaint with an amazing view of the canal, great natural light and had everything I needed to a 10 day trip. But the neighborhood is the best with boulangeries, cafes, cool shops abounding. There is even a grocery a block away. The metro is a ten minute walk but I walked almost everywhere because this area was quite well located for right bank site seeing. Would definitely recommend this place.",2016-01-13T12:31:32Z,5

5431201,18549627,Florian,"The best airbnb I can imagine. The location is great, wonderful view onto the canal, gare de l´est in 5 min reach, all the cool places around Republique not much further in easy walking distance. Balthazar was not there, but a nice friend of his handed over the keys personally, and Balthazar was super responsive by email. He must be a fun guy, and he definitely has a great taste. The appartement is beautifully decorated, you can tell its an architect´s place. For Paris, it is a very fine size, even for two, all equipped. It is super super clean, especially bathroom and toilet, rather hotel-like. The very best, still, is the Velux window - you have a view from the bed onto the stars, which you can close to sleep long after a long night.  Waking up then, opening the blind on the roof window remote from the bed, and the one to the canal, having a tea in bed with this view to wake up - pure luxury! From my side - just absolutely top, my favourite place in Paris. And I am there regularly for work, so I can tell! Thanks, Balthazar!",2017-02-02T09:56:17Z,5

And a canal right in front of the house where locals meet for drinks after work and hang out untill late. We joined them and had a lot of fun. (When you shut the window it's really quiet in the house, so you don't hear the noise from the street). Would definitely recommend this place. Oh and Balthazar, I really liked your interior.

Everything you need is present: kitchen, shower, toilet, fridge, combo microwave. And once you step out of the building, you can take a seat in the sunshine alongside the Canal St Martin. Close to 3 metro stations, among which Gare de l'Est, allowing to get anywhere in Paris relatively easy. Balthazar is a great host, easy going and communication was very fluent. Is there a downside?

7628898,45555951,Beth,"Marianne was overseas during my stay, however her friend and father were both very helpful and accommodating with any little issues. The apartment was clean and cosy, and a good generous size as Paris apartments go, especially for the cost. There was some street work going on outside and renovations in the apartment upstairs that were very noisy, but that was just an issue of unfortunate timing. It's a lovely area. Central to Sacre Couer, but set back from the heavy tourist areas. A lovely village feel with lots of great food and cute bars.",2015-11-28T12:41:19Z,4

Она нам даже показалась больше, чем на фотографиях. Окно спальни выходит в маленький французский дворик. Этого мы не знали. Это был приятный сюрприз. Очень красиво.
Перед поездкой Marianne очень нам помогла. Объяснила как доехать до дома, ответила на все наши вопросы. Большое ей спасибо. И всё время, пока мы жили у Marianne, мы были на связи. 
К сожалению мы не встретились с Marianne, так как её не было в Париже, и нас встречала её мама. Наш рейс задержали на два часа и мы не могли сообщить об этом. Мама Marianne дождалась нас на квартире, всё рассказала, показала и даже провела маленькую экскурсию по району, хотя было уже поздно. Спасибо.
Если будет возможность приехать ещё раз в Париж, остановимся у Marianne.

There's a wonderful bakery on the first floor so you wake up to the smell of baking bread, and quaint views of Parisian rooftops out of both rooms. 

Quick notes: The apartment is located on the seventh floor (6th if you're counting in French) and there was no elevator, so it may not be appropriate for people who are handicapped or have limited mobility. But if you're visiting Paris you're probably already doing plenty of walking and I enjoyed the exercise :)

Léa est une hôte exceptionnelle et une personne très accueillante et ouverte d’esprit - et son père aussi, qui est venu récupérer les clés au check out: c’était un plaisir de converser avec eux, on les a adorés ! Sa maison est un petit nid de beauté qui se trouve au sixième étage (sans ascenseur, mais ça fait du bien ;)) dans un très bel immeuble du bas Montmartre. Très bien aménagé, l’appartement est spacieux et lumineux, avec une vue magnifique sur les environs. En plus, il est situé dans une position absolument stratégique: à mi-chemin entre le Sacré-Cœur et la Porte de Clignancourt (tous les deux à distance de marche) et juste en face du métro Simplon, ce qui est parfait pour tout déplacement ! Donc, je ne peux que remercier Léa encore une fois pour sa gentillesse et recommander vivement son logement !

One day the internet went down, and I had 2 very important meetings coming up. He dropped everything and got on the phone with the service company and got it all resolved in less than 30 minutes! Just one example but he helped us out plenty during our stay. I can't stress enough how nice this man is! Thank you again Moshe!

The flat is perfectly described in the listing. It's small, but the space is nice. The neighborhood is awesome! I read a previous review saying the area was ""sketchy""? HAH! The neighborhood is vibrant and the people are so friendly! It's a lively area and normal to see people at the sidewalk cafe's drinking and eating into the late hours. People from all walks of life roam the streets. It's perfectly safe. My teenage daughters and I would be out picking up food at 2am. Never had an issue.

Several metro and bus stops are minutes away. You can be on your way to pretty much any where in Paris within 5 minutes.

27506294,135505153,Maciej,"I highly recommend this apartment. It's cozy and really stylish, situated on a beautiful street. It's perfect for couples and has everything you'd need. The only drawback was a really tight shower but this is understandable given the whole apartment is really small. It was okay for us but might be an issue for bigger people. The surrounding area felt safe and everything was really close to the apartment. Metro station and a supermarket are only 5 minutes walk from the place. I highly recommend visiting Parc des Buttes-Chaumont park, it's beautiful!

Anne-Marie met us on arrival and sent multiple emails during our stay, ensuring our comfort and suggesting a few new restaurants that have recently opened! She even welcomed us with bottled water and a fresh baguette. We'd return in a heartbeat and highly recommend it to others. 

The only aspect to consider is the stairs up to the unit (6 flights to the top), which was just fine for us, but possibly challenging for others.",2016-06-27T11:55:42Z,5
1987178,21986630,Pat & Jacque,Anne Marie was very helpful from the start and even sent us French phrases to practice for our trip! These came in handy!

She has a little book made of a bunch of good spots to eat, and was always super quick to respond if we had any questions. She greeted us with a delicious baguette and had some basics in the kitchen that she shared with us (juice, coffee, etc).  It is on the top floor, which is a bit of a climb, but its worth the view and the quiet off the street. Thanks Anne Marie! ",2015-10-11T13:09:03Z,5
1987178,179703,Steve,"Although I never met Anne Marie her communication was typically immediate and friendly, and her very good English more than compensated for my non-existent French.  

Her apartment is small but has plenty of room for singles or pairs.  Located in the far north of Montemarte, it is a good combination of the posh areas that are a few blocks south and the more ethnic/muslim areas to the north.   

Moreso than most airbnbs that are dedicated rental units, Anne Marie's place has a definite ""lived-in"" feel.  I personally like the personal touches of photos and work projects on the wall, but if you want the pristine impersonality of a hotel room, you might want to consider your options.

Great choice!

The apartment is very close to the Metro and the neighborhood provides a glimpse into the everyday life of Parisians away from the glitter of the more touristy or glamorous neighborhoods - we had a lovely time drinking beers in a Cameroonian bar next door. Our only caveat would be to say that this is not an apartment for those with big bags or mobility issues - it's a sixth floor walk up.",2014-12-23T12:12:56Z,3

The apartment is very quaint, clean, and made me feel like I was at home. The location in Montmartre is perfect, being located with 5 minutes walk to 3 different metro stops. Anne Marie goes the extra mile: There was a bottle of wine, some bread, jams, and water upon my arrival. I had a wonderful stay and I would highly recommend this flat to anyone traveling to Paris.

We arrived in Paris on the train and Anne Marie gave us excellent directions via the Metro to her flat. We're an older couple so the 6 flights of stairs gave us a 'workout', but it was good for us.

The bed is comfortable and the bath a welcome repose after a long day of walking around Paris. I would certainly stay here again. It is comfortable and feels like a cute second home!",2019-03-25T15:35:16Z,5
1987178,6729379,Katrina,"We had a lovely stay in Anne-Marie's apartment. We had just moved to France and stayed for one month whilst we looked for more permanent accommodation. The apartment had everything we needed to start to get set up in Paris. Whilst we did not meet Anne-Marie as she was away, she was great at communicating with us and providing recommendations of things to do throughout our stay. The flat is very close to the metro and to Montmartre with lots of cool bars and restaurants. We would definitely stay again. Both check in and check out were very easy.",2019-02-23T12:12:04Z,5
1987178,157831877,Caitlyn,Our stay at Anne-Marie's was perfect. We got to live like real parisians in her apartment. it's just a few minutes from two different metro lines. There are delicious patisseries all around. Grocery store close by. The apartment is super cute and has all the amenities we needed.,2019-01-21T14:18:26Z,5
1987178,31467978,Sally,"If you have strong legs and want to stay in Montmartre, stay at Anne-Marie's place! The six flights of stairs and no lift may be a deal breaker for you, but if not then the flat is great value for money. Situated in a residential, yet busy area, Anne-Marie's place gives you the sense that you are living like a Parisien/ne. The flat is cosy and quirky in its decoration and has everything you need for a short stay in Paris.",2017-04-22T07:35:55Z,5
1987178,31960281,Lachlan,"Anne Marie was the loveliest, friendliest, nicest host you could ever ask for! The listing is exactly as described everything was perfect. Anne Marie was so warm and welcoming when we checked in, and her apartment was the same. She kept in touch with us the entire time making sure we were finding our way around and went above and beyond to make us feel comfy. So perfect for two people for a few days. I went with my girlfriend for her birthday and it was the best 3 nights ever. The location is so close to Jules Joffrin station and Clignancourt so you can travel on both metro lines 12 and 4. We prefered to hang out around Jules Joffrin with the amazing bakeries and cafes. You must try a Nutella Crepe from the stall next to the Merry-go-round near the station. Thank you again for such an amazing stay, if we ever come back to Paris I couldn't imagine staying anywhere else! Merci Beaucoup!! ",2016-07-14T10:58:37Z,5

1987178,773324,Yewande YoYo,"We really enjoyed our stay at Anne-Marie's beautiful home. She definitely makes me want to travel more after seeing where she's been too! 

It was great for just the two of us (sharing a bed) and Anne-Marie had loads of things in place to make our trip very comfortable (towels, coffee, tea, heating, excellent spices, good wifi etc...), and anything we didn't have, there were supermarkets, grocers and little shops really close by and Anne-Marie was also on hand to help.

The location was perfect for us as it was really close to Montmartre (good food and good aesthetics), easy to get to Pigalle and super easy to get to the festival we were attending. It was also a great distance to the Metro!

On top of all the above, Anne-Marie is a really lovely person, striking a fine balance of taking an interest in us and our trip, and giving us room to explore Paris. Thank you Anne-Marie!",2016-06-07T02:08:07Z,5

It was perfect for the two of us with everything we needed, a big comfortable bed and lovely big bath. The stairs to the apartment kept us fit too. The lovely Anne-Marie greeted us when we arrived and kept in touch during our visit to check everything was OK and gave us great tips for places to visit and local amenities.

Pro:
- Sidney's partner Max was wonderful.  He helped carry our bags up to the sixth floor when we first arrived.  He sent a number of text messages throughout our stay and did his best to address our concerns.
- The location is fantastic.  Plenty of cafes, shops, and sites within walking distance.  Very safe, very fun.
- Lots of natural light.
- Comfortable bed.

Con:
Since we were living here for two weeks, we needed four things - a washer, AC, wifi, and a kitchen.
- The washer doesn't work.  We were told that the washer didn't work after we checked in via text message.
- There is no AC.  When we asked about it, we were told it was an old building and there is not any.  Max did try and find a portable unit 10 days into our stay but was unsuccessful.
- The wifi is spotty.  It wasn't unbearable but it would go out for hours at a time.
- The hotplates are broken.  Portable hotplates were provided but the unit took up the only counter space available as it is a small kitchen.
- We never met or communicated with Sidney.  Max was fantastic but we found it strange to never communicate with the listed host.  
- Some essentials were missing.  The towels, sheets, and toilet paper were abundant but all of the soap containers (shower, hand, dish) were empty.  Cleaning supplies were also empty (paper towels, general cleaning solvent).

Overall, we were disappointed.  The flat is not as advertised and would have never come up in our search had the description been accurate.  For the price, we could have stayed in a place with all of the items we needed for a good trip.  We made do, and if you don't need a washer, AC, wifi, kitchen, and/or essentials, then this place is great.  But if you do need those items, I strongly advise you communicate with Sidney or Max with your precise needs, even if they are listed, before paying.  ",2016-07-23T05:15:13Z,2
6271101,42370207,Richard,"The flat was great and accurately matched the photos posted. There was some initial difficulty checking in because of strikes going on when I arrived, but Max made sure to clearly communicate with me. The flat was clean and cozy. The bathroom/shower was kind of small which made it a little difficult to shower, but I could just be spoiled and not used to flats in Paris. The flat was located on the 6th floor of the building without an elevator, so it was a trek to make it up there. However, it was in a great location next to major subways so it was easy to get around. It was also in walking distance to the Eiffel Tower and Arch de Triumph. The door locks automatically when closed, and I accidentally locked myself out of the apartment. Max responded immediately at midnight (thank goodness) and met me up to give me a spare key. Without him, I would've been homeless for a night so I'm very thankful he was responsive and made the effort to meet me up. I would definitely recommend this flat.",2016-06-17T06:40:55Z,5

It is also just a short walk to the Eiffel Tower or the Arc de Triomphe. 

Sidney was a great host who was very welcoming and helpful. We had no issues during our stay and would definitely stay there again. Just be prepared for the stairs! ",2016-11-02T07:42:34Z,5

地點好，這個地區環境很高級。
缺點是沒有電梯，要爬六樓樓梯，洗澡的空間太小。我們住的時候是九月底十月初，不知道暖氣怎麼開所以還滿冷的(但躲進床鋪裡就非常舒適)。
Sidney剛好不在，請了朋友Maxime代交鑰匙，他非常nice而且很熱心，有問題問他都馬上回復。
我會推薦這個地方~~

No tuvimos inconvenientes con la entrega de las llaves ni al llegar ni al irnos, es más nos permitió dejar las valijas en su departamento por unas horas hasta que saliera el tren. Lo que si cuesta subir todos los días al sexto piso por escalera después de haber caminado mucho. Pasamos por una ola de calor tremenda y no teníamos aire acondicionado pero por la noche abrimos las ventanas y corría bastante viento cuando refrescada. Nos hubiese gustado encontrar el departamento un poco más limpio, pero de todas formas nos sentimos muy cómodos. ",2015-07-08T13:57:08Z,4

180950,194386994,Kiersten,"Dominique's place is in a quiet area with a wonderful little bakery right next door and several shops and restaurants within the surrounding blocks. We felt very safe, with two door codes and a physical key to get to the room. There is a steep and narrow spiral staircase that leads up to the rooms. It can be uneven and the handrail is loose, so pulling large luggage up (like we did) is a chore. The room itself is clean, but smaller than we felt the pictures led us to believe. We were wishing we had a fan on some nights, but the window opens to an enclosed area outside so that helped some. The provided dishes worked fine for a meal in. Overall, this space works great for two people. We stayed nearly two weeks and enjoyed our time there.",2019-06-16T12:12:43Z,4
180950,13383731,David,"This is a great spot if you want to be close to the metro and the tourist spots but also near places where actual parisians go. We loved the light from the courtyard window. The room was very small, but not uncomfortable. Definitely not the spot if you want to cook some stuff as the kitchen was non existant (as advertised). Go to the absinthe cafe around the corner for the hip vibe. The bar ""L'Attirail Café"" for a cheap ass dive with absolutely delicious fried potatoes.  Nice place to stay.",2019-05-06T12:12:01Z,4

You don't quite get the idea of that from the online pictures. Also the window overlooks a 4x4 mini courtyard surrounded by concrete walls. If you're into being out in Paris all day then this would be fine for your travels. But if you have kids and/or a lot of stuff you'll be a bit crunched.

He also had recommendations for us for our visit to Paris. And he is a very nice guy, the little we got to know him. The appartment is BETTER than the description. Here's why: 1. Spotlessly clean. 2. Very comfortable bed. 3. Great shower. Lots of hot water, and strong water pressure. (For my fellow Americans, you can tilt the shower head up and down, twist it side to side, even raise and lower the height. I mention this because I've been in France 10 days before I figured it out.) 4. Arnaud supplies a welcome bottle of wine. He also shared coffee, salt, butter, etc. so we could settle in before we had to go shopping. 5. Windows on 2 sides so lots of light and air. Plus three little (and I do mean little) balconies. No great view. Just the neighborhood, but it's nice to be able to step out. Bottom Line: Very nice appartment for 2 or 1, relatively cheep, with good subway access for exploring Paris. But with many charms in the neighborhood to enjoy. I moved my bottom line up, because I see I gassed on and on. Keep reading if you like. The real unexpected plus to this apartment is the neighborhood. The apartment sits on a block with no cars on a street that's 2 blocks long. Tres picturesc. On the corner to the left is a plant store that displays its flowers on the street. On the corner to the right is a green grocer with fruits and vegetables on display. Also on the block is a cheese store, a butcher, an omlette restaurant - open only for lunch, a fine food take out place, a Chinese food take out place, and a domino's pizza (Porquai !). The best bakery is to the right, across the street, 4th store on the left. Buy your fresh bagett every morning ! There are also drugstores and a supermarket within 2 blocks. If you are on a student budget, there's a Paul sandwich shop where you can get a ""hero"" sandwich on a bagett for about E5.50. Or a sandwich, croissant, and a coffee for about E8.50. I guess it's comparable to our Subway shops, except there's really no comparison. (Just a note here. If you really are a high school or college student, and you want a student neighborhood, this isn't it). My wife and I are retired and on our budget we enjoyed eating at a restaurant called MOM. (Turn left to corner, then right one block). Delicious food, and hip atmosphere. Complete dinner with wine, about E30 to E40 per person. They have a bar if you want in for less money. More to explore. Walking from the apartment: #Turn right 1 and 1/2 blocks, then left on Boulevard Pereire for three long blocks, around the circle and you...",2016-05-24T03:42:48Z,5

Sarah‘s communication was quick and friendly, and though she was not in Paris when I arrived, her friend met me and got me into the place without any issues whatsoever.

중간에 이해가 되지 않아 계속 연락했더니 친절하게 응대해주었어요
그래도 문제가 안되자 친구를 보내주었구요
숙소 위치는 역에서 매우 가까워서 편리했습니다. 집에서 그리 멀지 않은곳에 늦게까지 문여는 슈퍼가 있는점도 좋았어요
집 시설도 좋았는데 단 한가지 문여는게 매우 불편했습니다.
집 문은 시계 반대방향으로 두번반을 돌려야 열리는데 나머지 반바퀴는 문을 열면서 동시에 돌려야해요.
이 부분이 설명이 충분하지 않아서 문여는데만 1시간 넘게 고생하다 결국 친구분이 와서 문을 열어주었습니다.

3548824,21389811,Lena,"Die Kommunikation vorab der Reise lief sehr gut mit Caro. Sie hat mir über ihre Wohnung berichtet und erzählt wie die Nachbarschaft mit Restaurants, Bars etc. gelegen ist. Auch bei der Frage, wo ich mein Auto parken kann, hat sie mir gute Tipps gegeben.

Der Empfang in ihrer Wohnung war sehr herzlich. Einen Tisch in einem tollen Restaurant für den ersten Abend hatte Caro uns freundlicherweise auch bereits reserviert, so dass unsere Ankunft in Paris toll war!

Die Wohnung liegt sehr zentral und fußläufig kann man viele der Sehenswürdigkeiten in Paris erreichen. Man fühlt sich in Caros Viertel sicher und die Nachbarschaft ist sehr schön. Ein Supermarkt sowie eine tolle Bäckerei (Le Pain de la Bourse) sind ganz in der Nähe ihrer Wohnung zu finden.

Das Wohnzimmer ist sehr schön und gemütlich, hingegen das Badezimmer eher klein ist und das Schlafzimmer besitzt kein Fenster. Alles war ordentlich und frische Handtücher und Bettwäsche lagen für uns bereit.

Wir haben uns sehr wohlgefühlt in Caros Wohnung und das Viertel ist perfekt für ein paar Tage im schönen Paris. 
Caro ist eine tolle Gastgeberin und ich kann die Wohnung absolut weiterempfehlen!

The apartment is at the sixth floor, which can be a challenge to climb to after a long day of walking in Pairs. Very close to Brochant metro station. During the night some cars/motorcycles can be heard easily, this was a little disturbing but depends on how light is your sleep.

Communications with Sophia is amazing, she assist me on the instructions of checking in. Neighbourhood wise, it is very close to  school area, bus stop and metro,  at daytime it is relatively safe, at night time it can be a bit intimidating.

1810280,15117937,Angie,"A DEEP CLEAN RECOMMENDED: We started by mistaking our arrival date for a day earlier than when we actually were to arrive...Sofiane was flexible the next day by meeting with us at the planned arrival time, checking us in and making us feel welcomed into his home, offering coffee, and walking us through the layout and lighting of the room.  Know that he will stay across the hall and offer up his unit for you during your stay.  His personal items are around the unit so be aware of that as to why it is a ""private listing."" Unfortunately, after one night, we called to cancel our booking for the week.  We came to Paris for the 2015 Airbnb Open for hosts.  We knew we were taking a risk by booking with Sofiane because he has been on Airbnb for 3 years and only had 2 reviews.  We aren't sure why that is when we asked...perhaps many review would have been negative so people didn't write anything at all.  The location was perfect for the conference so we booked it. We were prepared to deal with our mild allergies of cats but when we arrived we started to smell and notice cleanliness issues with cat hair throughout this small space.  A deep cleaning of the space including the bathroom is highly recommended as well as regular vacuuming.  The biggest issue was that we notice the sheets on Sofiane's bed in the loft (you have to crawl up there, no room to stand but it is kind of romantic with the skylight) were clearly not fresh when we went to bed (a simple hard not firm mattress on the floor)...we slept despite our discomfort that night and checked out first thing in the morning after calling Airbnb to cancel.  If those things basic things such as clean sheets and a clean house (deep clean because of the cat hair) can be done, this could remain a listing in good standing. For now, we wish Sofiane the best and hope he understands these recommendations for better house-sharing behaviors of the future.  - A&C ",2015-11-14T10:51:24Z,2

Everything we needed like towels, bedsheets , his place was a breath of fresh air! Would highly recommend to stay here again!

A few things to note.  It is on the 4th floor with no elevator.  Not a big deal for us but just good to know.

Also there are cafes right out in front that are very loud until late at night (1 a.m.). It didn't really both us as we live in a loud and busy city and we are night people.  Closing the front window blocked the noise very well but it was a hot weekend so closing the window also blocked the nice breeze that otherwise would flow through the apartment.  We had to choose between quiet or a cool apartment-- could not have both.  A fan would be nice...

Finally, the bed was not very comfortable as it sinks in the middle and made for not the most restful night.

Overall though we enjoyed the experience.

Had dinner there at a different place every night. Felt very safe, and simple one route metro to the airport.  Apartment was simple and cute, had everything we needed and very efficient.  Nice to have the two small rooms, bed was very comfortable, kitchen was well equipped with dishes, silverware, basics for cooking breakfast.  The bathroom only had a tub with a handheld shower adapter, but we enjoyed the bath experience.  No complaints.  Great place - it is on the third floor with no elevator, so be prepared to walk up the stairs, but good exercise for us. No self check in, had to get a key fab for access but Xiaoling was there to receive us, explain everything and very nice! Great experience overall!",2022-05-17T12:28:33Z,5

However, there was a lot of building work going on to the building, which resulted in a lot of noise during the stay and the no blinds/glazed window in the bathroom meant quite an invasion of privacy with builders right outside sometimes! It didn’t interrupt our stay too much, but it would have been nice to be pre-warned about the work before arriving. Héloïse was a great host and helpful before our trip :)",2018-06-10T11:49:03Z,4

Melanie has a great apartment--even bigger and better than the photos show. The kitchen especially is fantastic. Everything was very clean and there was pleasant sunlight in the whole place.

Deux lignes de métro à proximité qui permettent de se rendre très rapidement dans le centre de Paris et à deux pas du parc des Buttes-Chaumont, l'un des plus beaux parc de la ville.

22289904,2018939,David,"Other guests indicated the place was clean. It was not. The floors were dirty, the refrigerator had rotted food and was packed with little room for a guest. The owner has a locked large walk in closet and stated she would empty the one near the bed. It too was filled with clothing.. only 2 dirty dusty shelves so I lived out of my suitcase. Even that was hard as her stuff was everywhere. Unlike the photo showing a nice open room, the space was filled with 2 broken chairs, a bicycle and stuff piled up every where. The wrong code for the lockbox was sent but luckily she quickly responded with the right one but after a long flight, this was annoying. The bedroom is actually in the floor below the ground floor which is a converted ’cave’. She has a dehumidifier running but it was noisy so if you turn it off at night, it gets damp.  She claims it was recently renovated but it appeared very run down and dingy.  Maybe I am too fussy in light of the other reviews and admit it was not expensive...still as I come often to Paris for work, you can find better. I suggest she perform a major declutter as there is stuff everywhere and no space for even one guest. The place needs small repairs everywhere...sagging shelves, leaking drain pipe by the toilet. Loose light switches and plugs of which many don’t work.",2020-03-05T14:07:55Z,3

Bogdan's brother Viktor was very helpful and accommodating,  we arrived earlier than check in and was happy to let us in earlier and gave us tips for restaurants/bars in the area. Full disclosure though, the apartment is at a fifth floor walk up, so you will get your exercise.",2016-11-13T07:12:35Z,5
15805091,46824212,Christian,"HOST
Ho soggiornato tre giorni con la mia ragazza, siamo stati accolti molto bene, l'host parla italiano, è stato puntualisimo sia al check-in sia al check-out, veloce e completo nelle risposte prima del check-in.

APPARTAMENTO
La casa è bellissima e accogliente ha un salottino con cucinino e una camera da letto abbastanza grande  con un balcone che affaccia sul corso e la vista è davvero bella.
L' appartamento si trova all'ultimo piano di uno stabile signorile situato in una a zona tranquilla, comoda e bella da girare.
C'è tutto l' essenziale, asciugamani, caffè/the, asciugacapelli, fornetto, fornelli, posate, piatto e pentole.
Abbiamo trovato la casa davvero pulita e il bagno molto profumato.
Pur essendo su un corso, con le finestre chiuse non si sente nessun rumore.
Il riscaldamento è buono (se messo al max è anche troppo)

TRASPORTO PUBBLICO
È ben servita dai mezzi pubblici, ai piedi dell'immobile ci sono le linee bus 21 e 27 con le quali si può arrivare direttamente all' Opéra(15mn), Louvre(10mn), Gare st Lazare(20mn).
Per prendere la metro o la RER basta camminare 10 min oppure 3 minuti con   il  bus 21 o 27 fino a Luxembourg, ma è più comodo spostarsi con i bus (a meno che non sia necessario attraversare tutta la città, a quel punto la RER e metro sono più veloci)

Facilmente accessibile dalla stazione Gare de lyon in 15mn (bus 93+27)
Inoltre a piedi dell'immobile è presente la stazione del Car sharing Autolib e la stazione del bike sharing Velib.

CONCLUSIONI: l' accoglienza è stata ottima, l' appartamento è perfetto per le coppie, accogliente, pulito e comodo ai servizi, in una zona tranquilla non degradata, senza delinquenza o persone poco raccomandabili.
Inoltre a pochi metri sono presenti mini market aperti anche di notte.
Consiglio vivamente l' appartamento di Bogdan!",2016-11-16T10:33:18Z,5

Walking around and getting lost in that area was the best decision my husband and I made. But most notable, we had such a great interaction with Ugo, pre-travel, while we were there, and after we left. If you haven’t already, hit him up with recs! You won’t be disappointed!",2019-12-31T13:23:02Z,5

19967211,7715380,Clinton,"Thanks for the excellent stay Ugo! Your place was perfect for my wife and my romantic 3 day getaway to Paris. 
We loved the location at the foot of the hills of Montmartre, and your place was very inviting and comfortable for our stay. Kassaundra was wonderful in giving us great advice for touring around the local area. We absolutely loved the advice to walk south from your place to get great fresh squeezed juices and tasty food, and to walk north up the hill to check out the amazing Sacre C’oeur and the Place du Tertre! These are both an absolute MUST see and scream what I would guess is quintessential Paris! 
We absolutely loved our stay at your place. Thank you for informing us in advance that most buildings in Paris don’t have an elevator. We got used to it quite quickly given the many stairs that we climbed in the area around Montmartre and the monuments of Paris in general:) 
5 STARS for your place, your hosting, and your location, and 10 Stars for Paris! If only all the smokers would move away:) That was our only issue with Paris, but this has zero to do with your place. Just a fact about Paris and I guess it gives it even more unique charm. 
Thanks again Ugo for a wonderful romantic stay in Paris.",2019-10-02T11:05:09Z,5

He is generous, quick to respond, always on-site to help, flexible, and a great hospitable host. I 100% recommend anyone to book Hugo’s place. It’s in a great location, within walking distance to many great shops and restaurants in Montmartre, and right across the street from a big supermarket for any last minute necessities you’ll need.

Alexis is a great host. He personally met us and gave us a quick tour of the apartment. He also gave us some suggestions on places to eat. 

The apartment itself is very spacious and we felt right at home after a long day of sightseeing. A big plus was the washer. There is no dryer but there is a rack in the bathroom to hang your clothes to dry. 

There’s three metro stations near the apartment that will get you to anywhere that you want to go to while you visit Paris. There’s also a grocery store and a pharmacy close by. 

Want to shop and eat like a local, Rue des Martyrs and Rue de Abbesses are very near. 
If you want to visit Sacre Cœur, it’s about two blocks up the hill behind the apartment. 

If we return to Paris we will definitely see if this apartment is available.",2023-10-24T13:02:40Z,5

The only inconvenience was the shower/tub since it's not enclosed but that's clearly shown in the images and you learn to deal with it after one or two uses.

Old world charm, decorated lovely, and the view is unlike any you'll get for the cost of a night. 
The neighborhood is our favorite in all of Paris. We had plans in other parts of the city and ended up cancelling some of them because we enjoyed our surroundings so much. 
Alexis is a great host and exceptionally accommodating. Do not hesitate to punch the ticket for this reservation.",2023-06-24T13:34:33Z,5
33511470,27879045,Benjamin,"Due to the lack of reviews, I almost hesitated to rent the flat for a night in paris. What a mistake it would have been, the flat is absolutely perfect for a couple wishing to visit paris. 
Located in one of the liveliest area of the city, the flat is still very quiet (gated residence, ensuring quietness and security). The nice ensuite room, (large bed, nice furniture) is quite large for Paris and the view is really astonishing. I would definitely recommend the flat for any visitors be it a long or a short stay (special recommendation for couples though...)

Muito Próxima da Sacre Coeur, facílimo chegar pelo metro Avenrs, não tem que caminhar nada.
Apartamento recém reformado, muito limpo, ambiente agradável, em andar térreo, o que pra quem tem dificuldades de locomoção é uma vantagem, apesar de se localizar próximo de um famoso ponto turístico a vizinhança é calma e tranquila.
A hospitalidade do anfitrião fez toda a diferença, ele nos esperou, havia água e muitas frutas disponíveis o que foi excelente após um voo de 12 horas!! 
Estrutura do apartamento foi impecável !! Roupas de cama limpas, cama super macia, chuveiro perfeito, cozinha impecável e equipada.
O anfitrião durante a estadia sempre se preocupava conosco e mandava mensagens frequentes para perguntar se precisa de algo ou para oferecer ajuda!!

34337617,95421406,Katherine,"This flat is a gem in the trendy, vibrant neighborhood of Montmartre. I wasn’t sure what to expect as a first time visitor to Paris, but Sumer’s flat did not disappoint!  

The flat can be described as a studio apartment that is separated into bedroom and living room areas by a divider, and with a spacious kitchen that contains a dishwasher and washer machine.  I appreciated the amenities offered, including standard things e.g. Wi-Fi but also a Nespresso machine and hairdryer.  And the elevator, which is unusual for an older building.  I also appreciated the host’s flexibility in allowing me to check in early, which meant that I could rest a bit after a redeye flight.",2023-02-23T12:06:01Z,5

Nicolas was very helpful when I suddenly extended my trip. He quickly made the necessary arrangements and was very accommodating to my change of plans. 

The apartment is pretty much as described and shown in the pictures. It is spacious with large windows and a balcony. It has amazing natural light and great ventilation. The apartment is simple and has all the necessities you may need while travelling. What I loved the most about it are the details in the art and decoration. It's definitely a cool apartment with a eccentric combination of modern details and classic French feel. It is perfect for people like me who are in the creative industries or a young couple visiting Paris. 

The location was perfect for my stay. It is in a cool and central area with lots of great restaurants and bars nearby. It's located at walking distance to Le Marais, Canal St Martin, Bastille and right next to the Republique square. The only downfall was walking up 5 floors since there is no elevator. Nevertheless, this is very typical of Parisian apartments and I must say that it kept me active. I actually enjoyed the extra exercise. 

I highly recommend this apartment. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and will probably be in touch with Nicolas for future bookings.

27097255,184187198,Viktoriia,"I rented apartment of Aline for a month initially and extended it for longer term since I was absolutely happy and satisfied with service, accuracy, cleanliness, location and hospitality of Aline. Location is impossible to beat. That’s the most prestigious and posh part of Paris, only few minutes walking from all the hot spots. To get to the Alexandre the Bridge it takes only few minutes on foot. There are all the amenities and facilities in place which makes the staying absolutely comfy for travelers. The windows overlook a serene lovely courtyard and atmosphere is very quite in apartment day and night time. 
Check in was as smooth as possible and I was helped with my luggage. Aline is always helpful and kind host. She provided me with a good discount for which I am so thankful to her. Bed is convenient to sleep for 2 people. I highly recommend this apartment to everyone and hope Aline will allow me to stay again in her place",2019-08-14T12:09:26Z,5

Located near a major train line (RER B) making it very easy to get from the airport to the apartment (30 mins, no transfers). The area itself is very safe and has easy access to the city of Paris through multiple subway and bus lines.

The apartment was just as shown in the descriptions and pics. It was very clean, cozy and a comfortable bed.

To keep in mind:
* the elevator is very small; not even as deep as the width of an airline seat. The stairs are good, all 56 steps.
* the entering and exiting the shower is tricky; a big step up with nothing to hold on to.",2023-05-25T11:06:02Z,4

As the weather was often cold, the apartment was always warm and had plenty of hot water.  The neighborhood is lively, with plenty of restaurants and nightlife, but the Coulée Verte is a short block away so there is always a quiet place to walk during the day.  The Marché Beauvau, Marché Aligré and Rue de Aligré are just a few blocks North, so there are some wonderful things to find to eat and drink.   And the bakeries... they're are many in the neighborhood.  I'm unable to recommend one over another, because they all have something special, so browse around and find what you like, not only bread (such wonderful bread)  and pastries, but sandwiches, salads, quiche and more.",2023-04-06T11:51:55Z,5

  We didn't meet Andréa but she stayed in communication constantly and answered all our questions immediately. Her friend Jessica received us and was extremely helpful.
 I would have given a 5 stars review had it not been for the bathroom. It might be perfect for young people but not for seniors. To get in the shower, you had an 18 -inch step up with nothing to hold on to, and getting out of the shower was even more dangerous.",2022-05-21T14:37:08Z,4

It does not have a kitchen, but that wasn't a problem as there are lots of cafes, restaurants, and food shops within feet of the building and all along the streets nearby. The apartment gets a lot of natural light and the small balcony overlooks the picturesque Rue Lepic. If you're looking for a place that feels like the romantic Paris of the movies, this is a great neighborhood and apartment to stay in.

As a host, Amelie was very accommodating. Check-in and check-out times were flexible, which was helpful for us, and Amelie was very good at staying in touch with us and made sure we got there safely. She also provided us with a list of her favorite cafes and restaurants, and nearby places of interest and public transportation. Overall, 5/5 star stay!",2017-03-31T09:25:10Z,5

Everything was great, Amelie was very kind and described us the way to the flat so that we didn't had any problems to find it. In the neighborhood there are many good restaurants and also some stores where you can buy fresh food, fruits and bread and Amelie also gave us some recomondations where to get good food :) The appartement is very cosy and nice, the bathroom seems to be very new and modern. Amelie told us that there is no kitchen in the appartment and that was no problem because of the restaurants in the area. Also the appartment was very clean and there was wifi. We also enjoyed the balkony which is small but its great to sit outside in the evening! In 5 minutes you can reach two metro stations and the sacre coeur is also nearby. Amelie told us that if we have any questions we could call or text her, she was really kind, nice and friendly.

8289268,14620065,Khrista,"We had a beautiful time in Amelies apartment! Although Amelie couldn't welcome us personally (she was working overseas), the communication with her was quick and she was very helpful. 

Suzanne, her friend, gave us a warm welcome and introduced us to the beautiful apartment. Everything was clean and we loved the cozy interieur. I loved the balcony, we enjoyed several glasses of wine and enjoying the beautiful summer evening sky over Paris. The bed was fine and the bathroom decor with the modern shower was excellent! Amelie informed before booking about the missing kitchen, but it didn't bothered us. 

We enjoyed our start of the day with an amazing croissant and pain au chocolat at the Boulangerie ""Alexine"" right across the street (highly recommended!) and you will find a lot of restaurants and cafes near the apartment. 

We had a beautiful weekend and hopefully we will come back soon!",2017-07-23T06:21:12Z,5

8289268,54367786,Paul,"The apartment is very lovely, the rooms are nice and prettily decorated, the balcony is narrow but comfortable and it's to have breakfast there in the morning. Near the flat, there are many bakeries, restaurants, shops, and pubs, I really recommend strolling through the district as you easily find something great and especially probably uniquely French. The metro is very close by, so you get around fast as well.",2017-05-21T06:36:42Z,5
8289268,36449051,Clarice,"I stayed with my husband at Amelie's apartment for 3 days and it was just perfect! Cozy, charming, cute, super clean and located at a great spot in Montmartre. It's surrounded by cafes, good restaurants, bakeries and a few Parisian attractions such as the Moulin Rouge and Sacré-Cœur Basilica.

Just walk 4 minutes and you'll reach metro lines and bus stops that will take you anywhere in Paris. Or, if you're into walking your way trough the city, it's just a 25 minutes walk to the Opera, for example. It's a REALLY convenient spot, for real.

Wi-fi signal is good, the bed is comfortable and the bathroom is shiny and beautiful!

In addition to all the great things about the apartment, Amelie is a really good host. She was very nice and attentive to our needs. For example: we needed an earlier check-in and she managed to accommodate us a few hours before the usual time. We also needed to print our bus tickets to Amsterdam and she gladly helped us with that. At the last minute, we had to checkout earlier than planned and she was there to get the keys back at the time we needed. 

In a nutshell: you'll have a really great time at Amelie's apartment :)",2017-05-17T09:31:01Z,5

The apartment is in an amazing location with lots of bakeries, shops and restaurants at your doorstep. The flat itself was very clean and bigger than we expected - also don't let the fact there isn't a kitchen put you off as there is a kettle, toaster and fridge provided which is perfect if you plan on eating out anyway. Overall we couldn't recommend Amélie's apartment more, and hopefully we will be back to stay soon!",2017-04-28T09:38:10Z,5

The apartment itself was exactly as described and was in such a great location. Loads of great bars, restaurants and shops a matter of seconds away and 3 metro stations nearby. Wish we had a longer stay, but at least we know of a great place for when we return (which we definitely will).

Lus также была очень гостеприимна и встречала нас по вечерам ласкаясь (это я про кошку:) Очень атмосферная парижская квартира, довольна просторная для Парижа, спальня, зал и небольшая комната с рабочим столом. Иногда по вечерам там ужинали, включали хорошую музыку и отдыхали, кстати такую же акустику по приезду я купил:) Квартира находится на 2-м этаже, рядом много магазинов и много станций метро (5 мин.) до центра добираться довольно быстро. По приезду встретиться не получилось с хозяином. Валентин оставлял ключи в специальном ящике отAirbnb в магазине с кодом, раньше такого не видел, но это отлично работает.

La déco est très soignée et on s'y sent tout de suite chez soi, accueillie par l'adorable petit chat qui garde la maison et qui est très facile à vivre. 
Valentine est une hôte très réactive et attentionnée qui a pris des nouvelles durant notre court séjour.
Je recommande vivement cet appartement pour sa localisation dans un quartier vivant et ses prestations très agréables qui en font un magnifique pied à terre pour un week-end ou séjour parisien.

Merci encore Valentine et peut-être à bientôt.",2018-07-08T11:24:16Z,5

They had superb communication with us leading up to our check in and stay, and were available during our stay with any questions we had. It's a fantastic location in a lovely area, with just a short walk to the Metro. And it's just a super cool apartment, we loved staying here. We unpacked our clothes into the ample closet space, got some food and did some cooking in the nice kitchen, and stayed as if we lived there. I'd definitely recommend it for any person or couple looking to stay in central Paris.",2017-05-31T07:56:06Z,5

The location is close to everything needed for enjoying Paris, and a leisure walk can lead you to downtown Paris in a short while. The check-in with bnbsitter was welcome. But if you need transit at chatelet/les halles for CDG or GdLyon, do note the transit walk to line 7 is not short.

After staying in Paris for about 9 days - we found that her location was our favourite in the city - not very touristy, quiet, EXCELLENT restaurants and cafes steps away, close to bikes and public transportation etc. 

The apartment itself is very spacious, extremely clean, and the decor is spot on (you really feel like you are staying in a quintessential Parisian apartment). If we come back to Paris - this is absolutely where we would stay!",2017-06-18T08:54:23Z,5

It is a proper one bedroom apartment in a non-touristy part of Paris. So you can be sure there will be quiet, there is a market and family operated restaurants around. The central part of Paris are easily accessible, so you get the best of two worlds. ",2017-05-02T06:22:19Z,5

33130164,1515269,Lucy,"Pierre was incredibly responsive whenever I had any questions or issues. The apartment is on a busy street but faces the internal courtyard so you do not hear any street noise. The apartment itself is perfectly pleasant, with plenty of room. It was missing a few key household items (paper towels,   dish towels, only one roll of toilet paper, only one bowl), which was a bit inconvenient. But the location and communication were both great.",2023-09-30T13:50:47Z,4

We loved the neighborhood and found so many great places to eat and shop close by. We liked how quiet it was in the apartment despite the ongoing night life on the street. It was very cosy, and generous in space for the two of us.",2023-09-26T13:55:56Z,5

33130164,193723757,Jonathan,"Pierre's place was in a great location, the street next to it was really lively filled with all kinds of restaurants and bars near it, along with access to two subway lines and buses. The unit looked just like the pictures and was very enjoyable. However, getting to the unit was a bit tricky - as you had to go through a door, a corridor, another door, up three flights of rickety steps and enter into a unit without a room number. The unit itself was nice, but getting in and out was a bit of a challenge. Also, the walls were fairly thin so it was a bit noisy at night. But again, great location.",2023-07-01T12:45:25Z,4
33130164,46418143,Mia,"A very nice flat with a large bed comfortable for two (vital after a long flight). The way to get in was a little tricky, but Max arranged for someone to give us the key and show us how to get upstairs—the passageway and stairs are a bit dark and it’s easy to get turned around because there are several gated stairwells, so having a guide was really helpful. Someone with limited mobility might have trouble with the entry, as well as with the tight bathroom, but we did fine. For a place in the middle of a major city it was very peaceful, with some ambient noise from neighbors and construction. It was great to have a washing machine on site, and the shower was easy to use. I would happily stay here again!",2019-09-14T13:46:14Z,5

Check in/out and the communication with Max was excellent. Highly recommend!",2019-06-02T14:12:26Z,5
33130164,48724539,Taufiq,"Max was an excellent host. Check in/out were easy. He has to let you in though for check in, which could be a potential issue if your timing is odd. Max was very responsive through Airbnb and whatsapp. The place itself was awesome -- and it looked much better than the pictures. Bathroom, shower, full kitchen were all great and sparkling clean. There is also a washer available that we did not use. 

The location is excellent with many shops/cafes/restaurants RIGHT next door. This place is also RIGHT next to a metro station (like you exit the stairs of the metro and face rightward and the door is right in front of you). Most things are easily walkable, but when we wanted to take the metro for slightly further places this was very convenient for us (and the Paris metro is really excellent). 

The place was nice and quiet for the most part, except for one night when American-sounding spring breakers decided to have a party upstairs. They eventually turned their music down after being chastised by the neighbors. 

Overall a really excellent find for a great value!",2019-03-29T15:45:03Z,5

As soon as we arrived there were instructions on house things like wifi and heating and a lovely bottle of wine to welcome us. Really we were touched. We messaged them to ask where the towels were and they responded straight away. As hosts they were top. The apartment was a PERFECT location and we actually looked at the hotel prices down the road and it was over £150 to stay a night in just a 3* in that area so we were really impressed. My experience of Airbnb is you get two types of apartments, the first is someones home that they have allowed you to enter briefly, the second is someones second home that has perhaps less of a lived in feel. This apartment is defiantly the first, a relaxed and warm couples cosy home overlooking the rooftops of Paris. We'd stay again. Lovely! ",2015-11-05T13:02:51Z,5

24274063,27399244,Pierre,"The apartment looks exactly as in the pictures. It's spacious, with a beautiful bay of tall windows, opening up to a little strip of balcony. The coffee table you see in the living room picture can become a dining table, with extensions, seating up to 6 people. 
 It is clearly the apartment of someone who lives in it. Don't expect a corporate apartment. It has its advantages: there are the essentials to cook with, the pots and pans are of good enough quality; you don't have to start from scratch. You will also see the  belongings of the owner, but François was fine with my moving things around to store my stuff.  Checking in was easy and François is extremely responsive. 
The building stands at the end of an enclave off Avenue Mozart, therefore it is very quiet. The location is ideal: between Ranelagh and La Muette Metro stations, very close to great food stores and supermarkets, cafes,  fine restaurants and the park. It's a posh, safe and clean area of Paris.  We had a wonderful stay and will choose to come back to this place again next time.",2018-08-30T11:56:18Z,5

The neighbourhood is quiet, safe, friendly, and vibrant with many shops, restaurants, bars, bakeries, butchers, and wine stores, etc. It is close to the Metro (2 minutes) and grocery stores.

Rapport qualité/prix: c'est très bien.  Nous sommes en plein coeur de Paris près de tout.

Not a big fan of the Murphy bed, but this is just a personal preference (it’s a little too tall for comfort).",2019-07-09T14:57:55Z,5
26031280,175510204,LaMaryia,"It’s in a really great location for metro, super secure, and definitely stylish. The bed is high so it’s a bit of work getting in and out but it’s secure so you don’t feel
like it’s going to break down on you. The neighbors are good nothing too loud. There isn’t a tv, but it didn’t really matter because there’s so much to see. Florent was amazing he responds almost immediately and is super helpful and checked in with us several times during our stay. There is WiFi it’s a bit slow but it’s still good. There’s a lot of great things within walking distance like a convenience store and restaurants which was a bonus because i didn’t use a rental. The street at the moment doesn’t have a lot of parking space and the space offered is metered. Overall I would say 8.9/10 Great stay!",2019-05-05T12:25:34Z,5

26031280,100599954,Paula,"Florent's friend Aldric was gracious and responded to my requests very quickly. The flat is modern and attractive as shown in the photos. The rooms are a nice size, larger than some Paris apartments. Excellent shower, excellent wifi, comfortable sofa, large dining room table, good kitchen. The neighborhood is very interesting and is definitely not in a tourist area--much more like a true Parisienne experience. There are many shops, restaurants, cafes, and the metro within a short walking distance.

There were some things that detracted from my experience. The UpBed pulls down from the ceiling and stays about 4' (122 cm) above the floor. It required me to climb up on a stool to get into and out of the bed. That was very awkward. The floor has four areas with ledges/changes in floor height, so I had to be careful not to trip. 
The entrance to the apartment requires walking through a courtyard past eight smelly rubbish bins, and part of the area isn't lighted at night.

The positive and negative aspects were about 50/50.",2018-08-31T14:14:52Z,3

Sollte man jedoch nicht so gerne klettern, ist das sehr erhöhte Bett (heruntergelassen) vielleicht nichts. Uns hat es nichts ausgemacht.

10689996,108596150,Adam,"Small apartment in the Latin Quarter where you can see the Pantheon from the street. 

The apartment itself was adequate for our needs (2 guys) if a little small. Wifi went out momentarily and our host reset the router by the time we got back. 

Highlight of this place is definitely the location. There's a wonderful market at the bottom of the hill where I grabbed breakfast every morning. Also a lot of cool, college bars in the area. We went to Long Hop and Pub Saint Hillaire and had a blast at both. 

About a 10 minute walk to Notre Dame and 5 minutes to the Metro. I felt like I got the true Parisian experience staying here :)

My friend left his jacket in the apartment and Juliette was nice enough to agree to ship it back to him.

557647,33613334,Anne,My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Pierre's apartment in the Marais.  Pierre was a very friendly and attentive host who made sure we had all the information we needed.  The neighborhood was very charming and full of delicious bakeries and shops.  The location is convenient to grocery stores and transportation.  The apartment itself is sunny and lovely.  We had a terrific experience staying here!,2015-07-13T12:59:47Z,5
557647,13266513,Faye,"Pierre was very responsive from the start of our communication which is one of the reasons why my boyfriend and I felt comfortable booking with him. After booking, he gave us details and different options for transportation to his apartment. The check-in was extremely smooth and easy. You have to walk many flights of stairs to get to the apartment, so if you have any injuries or issues you may want to consider that. It was tough with luggage, but after that my boyfriend and I enjoyed the work-out. It's tough to work-out on vacation, but we got ours from the apartment building! The kitchen is also dated, but who's really spending time cooking in there? Other than that, the apartment is adorable. I loved the big windows in the living room. Most importantly, the neighborhood is THE BEST! We enjoyed walking around in Les Marais, we also walked to Notre Dame and one night the Bastille area. The metro is very close by and you can pretty much get anywhere on it. Pierre is very pleasant to deal with and I highly recommend staying at his apartment!",2014-04-14T13:05:32Z,5

You are a very short walk to the Seine, an even shorter walk to the very convenient St. Paul metro station, and within a block of all of the amazing cafés, brasseries, bakeries, and bars of the Marais. We never got the chance to meet Pierre, but he coordinated everything perfectly and was very responsive to all of our questions. We'd really recommend Pierre's place!",2014-03-21T11:46:41Z,5

Could not have been more perfect.  I wanted to stay longer than 4 days.  The bed was more comfortable than my own, the shower was big with plenty of hot water, and I enjoyed my Nespresso coffee every morning with free wifi.  There's the most gorgeous Parisian courtyard behind the building - picturesque and quiet for sleeping.  Fourth floor was no big deal.  In fact, it felt good after all the profiteroles I ate.  Le Marais was dreamy - amazing restaurants, fun shopping, quaint and convenient to all the touristy stuff off of the 1 metro.  Above all, Pierre was a total sweetheart and responsive to whatever I needed.  Checking in and out was a snap and he even helped with some directions from the airport.  Pierre is the best host.  HIGHLY recommend his apartment!          ",2013-12-04T11:06:12Z,5

Brick and wood details of the apartment are beautiful and the view of the courtyard is lovely. Pierre was very helpful right from the start and made for a seamless check in/out. While the apartment is at the hub of many popular night spots, the bedroom is very quiet as it faces the courtyard.

The apartment is a great size- especially for Paris!- and in walking distance of loads of great stuff. Le Marais is a buzzing area- plenty of great bars and restaurants around which we managed to make a good dent in. 4 flights of stairs FYI- if you're not very fit could be painful. Otherwise, it's worth it and makes you feel better when you overindulge!  Pierre was a great host, very responsive and left clear instructions for us which made the trip easy. Would definitely stay again!",2014-04-08T11:44:08Z,4
557647,12787325,Edith,"5 STARS! Pierre provides l'apartment parfait:) Its located in a lovely Rue, superclose to the first must-sees around: Notre Dame is only a 5 minutes walk away, and the best Vintage-Shops and Falafel of Paris are found just around the corner, although we preffered to have a burger at Schwartz's (good price/performance aaand delicous!). All in all a perfect weekend with all the advantages of living on your one, especially in the untypically big apartment directly in the heart of Marais - very private! And the fresh baguettes and croissants from the excellent bakeries - aah, what else... :)",2014-03-24T12:39:52Z,5
557647,12677941,Yana,"This was my first time using airbnb, so I was a little worried not knowing what to expect.  It ended up being a perfect experience. 

Pierre is super responsive, so I got the instructions/directions right away and everything was just as described.  The apartment has a nice home feeling, plenty of light, is a mix of modern and the old charm, and it is in a fabulous location. 

If you are looking for something with a ""hotel feel"" where everything is sterile and sparkling, this may be not be the right choice, e.g. the kitchen wasn't brand new and the faucet leaked a little bit.  But I personally didn't care and couldn't have wished for a better experience.

4141009,27362485,Jun,"Nicolas place is clean and has everything in the house as Nicolas is living in the house.  There is two sides of the coin - you have all you need from cookware, cleaning supplies and toiletries.  He has a nice hairdryer and iron. 

Bonus: Nicolas got 2 fans and 1 portable air conditioner which is amazing as the day I arrived is very hot - 36C which I dun think I can sleep without it.  

However, same as other people comments, the wardrobe are fully occupied and you do not have space to hang your clothes which made the place messy during my stay. 

Location: it takes just 3 minutes walk to metro and walking distance 10 - 15 min to Lafayette and printemp.   You can find lots of cafe and supermarket around the area.  The area is safe and the police station is just one block away. 

I would definitely recommend staying at Nicolas place especially during summertime

The apartment was comfortable and well equipped. The kitchen and bathroom, particularly shower were good, better than other apartments we have stayed at in Paris. There was bar next door that was popular on a Friday & Saturday night but the windows were pretty good a keeping the noise out.
We loved the area, quiet, residential but with stations for 2 metro lines very close, plenty of local shops & restaurants nearly and only a short walk to the Sacre Coeur. 
We can highly recommend the food at the small morrocan restaurant, Le Petit Bleu - don't expect fine dining service, it's a takeaway with a few tables but the food was tasty and the portions big.",2015-11-09T16:16:05Z,4

Al día siguiente de nuestra llegada la puerta de entrada del departamento se trabó sin causa aparentemente (eso mismo nos dijo la persona encargada del departamento), motivo por el cual perdimos más de medio día de nuestras vacaciones hasta que se solucionó dicha situación . 
Dado que en el momento no nos cobraron ningún gasto de reparación, nos sorprendió desagradablemente que la dueña nos lo reclamara 4 días después, al momento de nuestra partida.  No hubo intercambio de palabras en malos términos con Capucine  pero si intervino Airbnb. Cada uno realizó el descargo pertinente y se resolvió que nosotros, los huéspedes, NO teníamos porque pagar la suma reclamada.

Perfect for a couple and safe to walk around at any time. The place had all we needed. If you have a netflix account, you can log in the tv and watch whatever you want, if you don't wanna watch regular tv before bed, so that was pretty nice. We enjoyed it very much.

7235572,43902248,Ahmed,"We (a couple) satyed 4 nights at Marie's apartment. The address was easy to find and on arrival we found everything neat and clean.
We didn't get an opportunity to meet Marie in person, but found her helpful and the key arrangement was also convenient.

The positives and negatives from our experience are,
+ves: 
Metro and bus stations are right next to the apartment building. There are many food and fruit shops in front of the building including a super market. Kitchen is well equiped with all the cooking utensils, refrigerator, baking oven etc. Bathroom is clean with a nice shower and a washing machine. Apart from the bedroom the house has a living room and a small balcony. Wifi signals throughout the apartment.

-ves:
Apartment is on the fifth floor without any elevator, which is not very pleasant especially after a long day of exploring. The neighbourhood is busy and loud and also slightly far away from the city center. You need to change two Metro lines to get to the main tourist attractions (roughly 30 minutes). The apartment in itself is quite old and lacks fresh air and opening the windows could be noisy.

If you don't mind staying in a not-very-central and busy neighbourhood then we definetly recommend Marie's apartment.",2016-07-12T08:13:48Z,4

She answered our request within minutes and was professional and kind during correspondence. The apartment itself is comfortable and fairly quiet, save the talented yet frequently singing tenor next door. It is located on a smaller street off the main Rue de Belleville so traffic noise was limited. Its proximity to the main street was very helpful with metro stations in either direction and grocery stores, bars, and restaurants in immediate proximity. The neighborhood is where actual Parisians live and hang out which made our experience more valuable.

The guests before me had broken the shower but was temporarily fixed for my convenience, when it broke again during my stay it was quickly fixed so it wasn’t a problem.

Jean-Baptiste had given me a list of places to see in the neighbourhood and I was very grateful as the places he suggested were perfect.

Communication with Charlotte was quick and easy, and even though I have not met her and her partner, the transfer of the keys was arranged smoothly. It is close to public transport, multiple metro stations and rer A and D. There are plenty of restaurants, and shops around and you can also walk to Bastille for even more.

Literally 30 seconds walking from the tube station as well as Butte Chaumont park, the most beautiful park of Paris!
The propriety has an amazing view on the park (which you cannot really see from the pictures I think) as it's at the 9th floor (with elevator) and is bright and fresh.
The kitchen is equipped with everything you could wish to have for cooking at home and the whole apartment has been  refurbished just a few years ago.

However, there were problems. The owner is a smoker, and the bed smelled of smoke. The owner did not specify any cleaning fees, but now insists that I should pay her €80 after the fact. This pretty much has ruined my opinion about this host. I will not pay the cleaning fee after the fact. All charges should be disclosed in advance, so I can make the decision about renting a place or not.",2017-06-04T13:17:53Z,2
7066124,36559900,Desiree,"Veronique was a pleasure to meet. She welcomed my guest and I on day one and was very patient with answering questions and making suggestions. She travels a lot so she was not around after the first day and instead emailed periodically. It was actually great not having someone constantly stopping in and checking up as that sometimes tends to make you feel like an unwanted guest. We instead felt extremely comfortable and it really gave us the feel of it being our little home during our stay. 

The view from the apt is an experience in itself. It made every night coming home even more magical. The view alone is why I would definitely stay here again on my next trip.

The only negatives were there is no ac and no microwave, which on the few days out of the month that we spent inside all day was a little rough. However, if you are like most, you will be out sight seeing and dining out the entire trip so bedroom comfort, clean big shower, amazing view/balcony, and the large amount of space we had to spread out our luggage were the most important things to me and this flat succeeded in all of those areas.  

I will definitely be back!

The apartment is not only super cute, but it is also very comfortable in it's size and amenities that it provides. It was nice having a tv, wifi and washer. Also,  Chloe is extremely thorough in explaining check-in, check-out, things to do in the area, and overall makes you feel like she is there for you if you may need assistance. She always responded to me right away. Lastly, I would like to mention that I traveled alone and always felt safe and was very comfortable.

26283966,9060287,Priya,"We enjoyed our stay at Chloe's place.  It was the perfect place for us to rest our heads, cook breakfast, and explore Paris for a few days.  Chloe was very responsive and helpful in our booking and ensuring we could check-in.  She was also flexible when we requested to extend our stay.  Her apartment was spacious yet cozy and decorated very well.  The only odd part is that the toilet is off the kitchen, while the rest of the bathroom (bathtub/shower + sink) are off the living room.

Future guests should know that she does have a cat so there was cat fur in the apartment.  I wish I had known prior as I'm allergic to pet dander.

26283966,55496998,Davor,"A stay with Chloe's place was a very smart decision to stay in Paris. Location is perfectly positioned and you will have everything what you need there. There is supermarket near, Metro, Gare du Nord is 15 minutes away (walking). You are on the foot of Montmartre so you can walk there. What we like the best with Chloe's place is the spirit of the place. It brings that Parisienne feeling and you are able to experience if you live there as a local. We also liked the decoration of her place in that nice vintage style. We enjoyed much more as we would enjoy in some expensive hotel where you will get only room and beds and that it is.
All ammenities were working great, Wi-Fi was fast, hot water available. Also means for cleaning are provided and available. Chloe is super host and she will answer all your questions you might have about the Paris, food, favorite places to eat, bakeries and so on. Thanks to this selection we will remember our visit to Paris even more. Until next time.",2018-09-14T12:45:23Z,5

The place isn't huge, but there's plenty of space in the kitchen and living room areas. The bed area can be a little dark since there aren't a lot of windows, but that's about the only downside to this place. Big plus for being on the ground floor and in a quiet area.

8250349,52713437,Peter,"Gilles' apartment in Paris was perfect for my husband and I. We were met on time, at the front door. After a quick tour of the VERY CLEAN apartment, we were on our own! The apartment is on the ground floor, convenient if you have a few pieces of luggage.

Everything is as pictured in the listing. The rough stone walls and wood floors brought the charm of the Le Marais neighborhood inside. All of the furnishings were in great condition and the bed was very comfortable, too. Plenty of clothing storage in the closet and under-bed drawers. 

The kitchen was fully outfitted as expected - dinnerware, pots and pans (even a wok!) and plenty of glasses for the delicious French wines. Although there is no clothes washing facilities in the apartment, there's a great little launderette just a few doors down.

The bathroom was perfect for two people - and there's plenty of hot water :-)

The neighborhood is vibrant and there are plenty of places to eat within walking distance. I'd recommend to check out the open air market across the street and the boulangerie around the corner. It's also a short walk to two Metro stops which can get you just about anywhere in Paris quickly.

All-in-all, we had a perfect time in Paris! Gilles' place will always be at the top of my list when I visit Paris.",2016-05-29T02:18:31Z,5

8250349,3952608,Cheryl Ann,"Amazing space!!!! We stayed in Gilles' apartment for just over a month and we loved it the moment we stepped in. Possibly the best airbnb that I have stayed in Paris (I've stayed in many). We had initially wanted to extend our stay for another month but unfortunately it was already booked out.

Everything was just as described and shown in the pictures. The kitchen was fully functional, except that you need to open the windows when you cook as the ventilator above the stove was not installed to actually work. Bathroom was sufficient and fully functional with good water pressure. The bed was comfy. We especially loved the salon with the couch and tv.

The neighbourhood (le Marais) was bustling and dynamic, yet the apartment provided a calm and cozy nest to rest and recharge.

One point that could possibly be a down-side is that the apartment is situated on the ground floor. And sometimes at night the sound of rodents scurrying outside could be slightly unnerving.

Loved the place. Would definitely recommend. :)",2016-05-01T01:42:27Z,5

Her flat is in the middle of everything (amazing restaurants/patisseries, night life, sites, public transit).

The bathroom is a bit small if you are tall, and the apartment is on the 4th floor without an elevator.

The area is lively and comfortable, with lots of shops, restaurants and supermarkets nearby. It's also very well connected for traveling around the city.
My only issues were the absence of a proper dining table and the absence of an elevator, but they don't really matter because the apartment is gorgeous and quite big!",2023-12-11T14:22:16Z,5

27564056,72171056,Patricia,"The apartment is beautiful as shown in the pictures, very sunny and absolutely well located. All around the area is plenty of bars and restaurants and the fact that the apartment is on the last floor makes it very quiet.
One recommendation I’d like to give you is to provide the apartment with a closet a coffee maker, more pots too cook or boil water and a place where to let them dry. The apartment also needs a great cleaning in order to become more comfortable and livable. One more thing, it could be convenient to remove all the personal belongings from the apartment like pictures of friends and various objects that are not useful for guests and make it feel like someone else’s home.
Thank you!",2023-06-04T12:07:40Z,4

Since I'd like to be honest - the value for money on this one is perfect, however, there are couple of cons I wasn't aware of at the beginning. The apartment has a very specific smell, which is not exactly pleasant. Secondly - I've been to many houses via Airbnb, but this one was definitely the least clean (bathroom, kitchen utensils, oven etc). What is also worth mentioning - although the street looks calm and quiet, there are a couple of social accomodations down the street (check ""Adoma""). There are always people standing in front of it, so it gets noisy at times.",2019-08-01T11:51:19Z,3

First, after I already booked the apartment she asked me if her boyfriend's cat could stay there -- I was going to stay the following day and so I didn't want to look for another place at the last minute and I said it was fine. However, the cat was very freaked out that I was there and was spraying everywhere and I broke out in hives after sitting on the couch having only been in the apartment for 20 minutes. Also, there was no internet! I was traveling internationally and did not want to use my data which is expensive, and my main requirement when looking for a place was to have a wifi connection. Considering both of these things, I asked for a discount which she said she would do, and yet never did anything. I am still waiting for a discount, I will contact AirBnB. ",2015-08-31T18:13:23Z,2

4631245,44400302,Helene,Our stay with Juliette was awesome. We didn't meet her in person but the apartment matched the pictures exactly. It was big enough for two and we had everything we needed.

Pas de draps, ni serviettes, disponibles à l'arrivée des voyageurs. Linge de lit et de toilettes ""tournant"" dans la machine à laver. Donc indisponible pour le soir et à l'état de chiffons pour le lendemain. Des lampes mais pas d'ampoules fonctionnelles. Porte d'entrée, pour le moins non sécurisée, serrure ne fonctionnant pas et note humoristique, l'adresse du serrurier à l'extérieur de la porte…
Donc tentation immédiate de rebrousser chemin et d'aller dormir à l'hôtel.
Ne devrait pas être en capacité de recevoir des visiteurs.
Scandaleux.

그리고 빠른 답변을 받을수 있었고,
상냥한 juliette은 친근하게 대해주고,작은 실수도 쿨하게 이해해주었다.
그리고 집은 사진보다 훨씬 더 아름답고 아늑했다.
The station was near the house and the station was a convenient station that conveniently moved all the tourist attractions.
And I was able to get a quick answer.
The friendly juliette kindly treated her with familiarity, and made little mistakes in small mistakes.
And the house was much more beautiful and beautiful than the picture.

Few things I want to point out is there only one small trash can in bathroom in the apt, it would be nice if there at least one more in the kitchen! And, some of the kitchen appliance needs to be clean a little! Also, it took a few messages to have an answer, so better communication is needed! However, Ben is kind enough for me to leave my suitcases in his flat for two extra hours after checkout which I greatly appreciates it! Very nice of him!

The key was left for us under the mat which was wonderful as we were tired on arrival and didn't want to wait for a host to meet us. 
I would encourage you to confirm a departure time so you are not forced out of the apartment without warning at 10:00 a.m, as we were.

Other than that one inconvenience, we had a lovely stay at Benjamin's apartment in Paris.

Heating worked well with heated towel rail 
Good internet and TV setup 
Ben was a very welcoming host 

Cons:
There appears to be much more furniture in the photos (I.e there is no kitchen table or second couch)
Kitchen cleanliness was not great
The kitchen lacked necessities, only two cups and no wine glasses

It's in the inner section of a building so it's quite quiet when school is not in session.

One warning is that there is a gym or school nearby so in the mornings you can hear children playing if you have the windows open like we did for fresh air. Also the shower door was rather hard to get out of, but both of these are minor things for an otherwise great apartment. 
The bed was very comfortable (esp after walking all day!) and the apartment building was beautful and safe.

Fantastic old building with lots of character but also updated, quiet and in the back of the building far away from the busy street. My only challenge with the experience was communication with Antoine; he wasn't very responsive in advance of the reservation regarding meetup timing/entering the apartment, and then a last-minute emergency prevented him from meeting me at the agreed-upon time. I can see from the other reviews that I am not the only guest who has had communication or meetup issues. My suggestion would be to arrange a reliable backup plan, such as hiding a lockbox in the entryway with the key, and send the guests instructions for accessing the flat via the lockbox a week before the reservation so that guests can get inside in case of any problems. Once I was in, I was very glad to be there!",2016-10-31T09:21:40Z,4

If you are looking for an authentic Parisian stay, this is the neighborhood for you. The bed is very comfortable as well. We had a couple of problems with hot water access and the lights in the bathroom, and frequently needed to flip a switch in the circuit breaker cabinet to turn them on. 

Unfortunately, Antoine was a bit difficult to get in contact with, we sent multiple messages letting him know when we would arrive before hearing back. He had to send a friend to let us in, and we had trouble reaching the friend as well. Like others, we would suggest a lock box or other way to exchange the key.

Perfect location to visit Paris, well connected by metros (and of course the public bicycle sharing system), but even so well located that you can actually discover many sights by foot. Neighborhood (St. Germain) is quite posh for shopping.

As you can already see on the photos, the courtyard is a real highlight. The apartment itself is spacious and would be ideal for a couple.

13843193,10718632,Elina,"The room was as described, and the location was good. The person who initially met us was friendly and gave us a thorough tour before we got settled in.

Unfortunately, there was no wi-fi, though it was guaranteed in the description. As travelers, it was crucial for us to have this amenity as we needed it to plan both our time in Paris as well as beyond.

Communication from Houssen was almost non-existent, and the few instances were sent through means which he obviously knew we did not have access to, so we ended up spending a hugely significant sum of money, time, and energy that we didn't have on finding wifi at cafés and restaurants rather than experiencing the city (or even the restaurants). 

Overall, the lack of communication, follow through on promises, and accountability added extra pressure on us that ended up compromising our stay. 

In the end, he offered to compensate us, and sent us $8 for the trouble. Based on all the additional costs and stress, we do not recommend paying to jump through hoops with Houssen.",2016-07-24T05:48:51Z,2

The location of the apartment is ideal, offering easy access to many modes of transportation, restaurants and shops.  
One gesture I found especially helpful, was Clemences' willingness to go through the list she'd provided , explaining how to operate the appliances and electronic devices throughout the apartment, recycling procedures, washer/dryer use, and other amenities, enabling us to partake in all that the space had to offer.

He even provided us a list of food recommendations in the area. When the bedroom fan didn't appear to be working at first, Sylvain offered to bring us another one. Fortunately, the fan just needed a little time to warm up, but I was very grateful for his offer. The apartment itself is super charming, clean, and cozy. It is on the fifth floor of a steep walk-up, but that was clearly advertised in the listing, so make sure that you can climb all those stairs before you rent it!

The neighborhood was central to everything I needed, very close to subway stations and stores, food, etc. 
Sylvain and his girlfriend were very understanding about my late flight/arrival and waited for me to get in. They explained everything to me and even gave me directions to some places for the morning. I felt very welcome.
He was also very accommodating, bringing an extra heater when one wasn't working. 
He was flexible with my checkout and even gave me directions on how to get back to my airport on the last day.
All in all I would definitely recommend this apartment to others planning to stay in Paris. It's a great location to experience the city from, just a short walk from the Seine!

2581820,72050858,Kirsty,the area was lovely but the street of the apartment is a little less appealing on first arrival but this wasn't a problem once we knew our way around. The stairs are very steep but this kept us fit! The apartment was small but cosy had everything we needed. Ceilings so ugly lower than expected but not too much of a problem. Our host was easy to contact and provided lots of helpful information. Good location with easy access to th metro. ,2016-08-21T08:50:43Z,4

2581820,1546658,Charlotte,"Nice little apartment in a great neighbourhood - we didn't cook there but it looked really well equipped. Quite low ceilings so might be tricky for taller people than me! Sylvain was a great host, really responsive and was really helpful with our arrival and departure times. Would definitely recommend as a little hidey-hole in the Marais. Thanks Sylvain!",2016-07-06T11:23:41Z,5
2581820,15398690,Jacob,"Sylvain cozy flat is exactly what we were looking for on our first trip to Paris.  It was situated in a quiet and safe neighbourhood with easy access to public transportation and groceries, with plenty of bakeries and brasseries close by.  Sylvain was very accomodating and addressed every question we had.  It is on the top floor of a 5 story building so as long as you don't mind the walk up, it is quite a lovely place to stay.  We'll be looking forward to staying there again on our next trip to Paris!",2016-07-03T01:59:23Z,5
2581820,43102842,Andrea,The stay at Sylvian's apartament was awesome! It has everything you need and the bed is super confortable. The ceiling is not too high but there wasn't a problem for us. The location is excellent and also you have a metro stop just around the corner. Sylvian was great from the beggining. Our train had a delay and he wait for us till late anyways. He is very helpful. He recommended us places to eat and answer all of our questions immediatly. If we ever come back to Paris we will stay at his apartament without a doubt! Sylvian thanks for everything!,2016-06-10T02:18:59Z,5
2581820,47090040,Frederik,"Sylvains place is located in a little side street in the very center of Paris from where you have a lot of sights and places in walking distance. The apartment is clean and cozy and Sylvain is a great host and always willing to give you advice whenever you need it. Only thing is the ceilings are low, so if you are as tall as me (190cm), watch out your head. All in all a Great place to have a good time in Paris! ",2016-06-05T01:59:38Z,5
2581820,701304,Barbara,"What a perfect spot to stay for a visit to Paris! The flat is very clean and has everything you need for an enjoyable stay. It's conveniently located within walking distance of many sights, and buses and metro stations are just around the corner for easy access anywhere. There are also great shops and restaurants close by. Sylvain is a perfect host, very attentive and communicative. I felt very safe and secure and welcomed. Highly recommended!!!",2016-05-26T00:44:22Z,5
2581820,280414,Pere,"Sylvain's place is great to explore Paris from one of the best neighbourhoods in the city. It's close to really good places to eat, have a coffee or a drink, and you can follow Sylvain's great recommendations for food and drinks. Everything you need is whithin walking distance, and at the same time the place is very quiet, you can hear the birds sing in the morning :) Facilities in the appartment are in perfect condition, and are beyond what is expected. For instance, you have a great internet service with many TV and music channels, as well as Airplay to play your iPhone music or movies, which is a great plus. All in all, perfect place to enjoy Paris, with a great host that can provide lots of good recommendations. ",2016-05-21T02:25:50Z,5
2581820,63689510,Milos,"Flat is in perfect location, near metro station, nice caffe's and markets.
Nice place for descovering Paris by foot . Sylvain is great hoast. We have early flyght when we were arriving and late flyght when we were leaving but there were no problems with our baggages. Sylvain let us leave them in flat. 
This is  a great place for 5-10 days stay.
I am tall (>1.90m) so I had little problems in bathroom (but he mentioned that in listing).",2016-05-10T03:38:55Z,4
2581820,37047488,Emma,"We stayed in Sylvain's apartment for 3 nights. It was in a perfect location, 5 minutes walk from the metro and close to the supermarket and local restaurants. We loved the rustic building and being on the top floor made it a very cosy home for our stay in Paris. There are low ceilings and a lot of stairs but  we loved the quirkiness and it is was such a unique find. :)",2016-05-04T00:55:55Z,5
2581820,14000039,Antero,"Sylvain's appartment was just as described in the listing. It was clean and cosy and fantastically located (next to excellent subway connections but still on a quiet street, and in a walking distance from many of the coolest sights in Paris). Sylvain and his girlfriend were excellent hosts: easy to communicate with and ready to help. 

As the listing says, I would not recommend the appartment to tall people (or people who mind climing up to the fift floor). Otherwise, I have only good things to say about Sylvain and his appartment. We had a great stay and would love to come again.",2016-05-01T01:51:13Z,5
2581820,24900115,Hidde,"Our stay in Paris was great. Sylvain and his girlfriend were super friendly and helpful. The apartment was really clean and cosy, not really built for tall people, but that was already noted in the advertisement. The location couldn't have been greater, it was super central. From there we were able to walk almost everything.
I would really recommend this place to everyone!",2016-04-23T02:05:10Z,4
2581820,55891674,Veronica,"Sylvain and Adine were so kind and helpful, they gave us a warm welcome in 
Paris and provided us with useful info. The house was clean and very well organised, every space was studied to be confortable. The building was old but quiet and the location was perfect to experience Parisian life by foot. ",2016-04-20T01:32:10Z,5
8010773,103248555,A,A very easy check -in process. The host was very responsive to all of my questions. The images were just as advertised. I had a wonderful stay. The area has lots of activities. It is also very close to two metro lines. Flo’s home is a great place to stay.,2024-03-16T15:25:47Z,5
8010773,100932430,Jared,"Phenomenal apartment, phenomenal neighborhood, phenomenal host. There’s no better place to stay in Paris, especially for the price. Flo, the host, was responsive, helpful, and all-around great. I stayed for several months and it was perfect for that. Reliable internet, good kitchen, large fridge, etc. It would also be great for just a weekend stay. Highly, highly recommend!",2023-05-05T12:47:41Z,5
8010773,302603470,Dionaris,I stayed at Flo's apartment for a month on a trip from NYC and it was the most perfect place. Spacious and a perfect location. Multiple subway stations are just minutes away and there's a gorgeous canal as well. The stairs to the lofted bedroom are a bit steep so may not be preferable if you have any leg/knee issues. Otherwise the apartment had everything I needed and Flo was always very helpful and responsive. Would definitely go back!,2022-08-01T13:35:29Z,5
8010773,10509560,Spencer,This is the best Paris AirBNB in the price range by far. I had a fantastic month here and look forward to booking it again. Highly recommend!!,2021-08-31T11:59:32Z,5
8010773,1781977,Kate,"This was the perfect spot to spend a week solo. The proximity to the République metro stop meant that everything felt close by (though Paris is so walkable, I didn’t take it all that much!).  The few times I came back from exploring in the middle of the day, I really enjoyed all the light in the apartment, thanks to a big window and skylight. While the apartment is technically small, the layout makes it feel bigger and it felt like more than enough space for for me. It probably would have been just as comfortable with a partner. As some other reviews note, there is a lively bar downstairs and people gather there till late. It didn’t bother me, but if you’re sensitive to noise, pack accordingly. Already scheming to return and stay here again ASAP.",2019-09-26T11:04:29Z,5
8010773,61836308,Sibylle,"You will be in the heart of Paris in an animated neigbourhood, close to anything you want to visit. A lot of nice restaurants arounds especially rue Amelot. You should enjoy your stay and experience Paris.",2019-09-19T13:29:30Z,4

8010773,8905977,Jen,"I stayed in the apartment for six nights and it was easy to feel like it was home. I arrived in the middle of a heat wave and was worried about being on the top floor with no air conditioning but because of the big windows in every room, I was quite comfortable! 

Everything was very clean, the linens were very soft, and the kitchen had everything I needed (and more!) for cooking in. 

As was expected from reading other reviews, there was some noise from the school in back in the morning, and the café and bar in the front at night, especially because the windows needed to be wide open for cool sleeping. But it was easily managed with ear plugs!

I am sad to be leaving so soon and hope this place is available next time I’m in Paris!",2019-07-03T12:28:19Z,5
8010773,524315,Terry,Amazing apartment. A short walk from the canal and République. The loft bedroom is so cozy with the skylight and movie projector!,2019-06-18T13:24:31Z,5
8010773,30986615,Rajiv,"Had a wonderful stay.  Apartment is exactly as described.  It’s small, but perfect for a solo traveler/couple.  It’s top floor, so may not be the right fit for everyone.  I found it to be the perfect place to chill after sightseeing in Paris.  It’s not the place to hangout in all day, I think it’s too small for that.  Location is great, only one block from the canal and tons of local restaurants around the neighborhood.   There is a bar across the street, and the street noise could be bothersome for some, but it didn’t pose any issue for me.  I actually loved the people watching, the locals would sit at the cafe/bar in the late hours, there was a ton of energy within the neighborhood and that’s what I loved.",2019-06-05T11:59:51Z,5
8010773,23604628,Jon,"Beautiful stylish apt
Small but great space

Flo was great.  

Would stay there again in a second.  

Can see Sacre couer from window if u stick your head out!

No complaints! Would stay here again!",2016-10-16T09:54:21Z,5
8010773,1025296,E.J.,"Flo's place is tiny but super cute, like the most French bachelor pad you could imagine. Don't plan on crashing on the couch clandestinely, it's too small and (as I discovered when I fell asleep there on accident one evening) pretty hard. AND keep in mind it's a ***5th*** floor walk-up, so you might want to pack light. But the flat has everything you need and you're right in the heart of Republique. Flo was super chill and quick to take care of something when I asked. I'd stay there again. Thanks!",2016-09-18T02:37:40Z,5

There was a lot of space for two adults to spend several days in and the home was comfortable. All of the windows face a quiet courtyard and it was very peaceful at night. My husband appreciates the fast internet for working. The location was in a lovely area of Le Marais with many restaurants and cute shops.

It’s walkable distance to the Picasso Museum, and other great locations. It is an older building (very normal for Europe), but Lola has done an amazing job decorating and putting her personal touches all over so you really feel at home there. It’s a great space that had me feeling comfortable and safe, perfect for relaxing after a big day exploring Paris. It’s also accessible, with a small elevator that can take you & your luggage up to her floor. Her building also seems to be popular with Airbnb folks, as a family was checking in the day I was leaving! 

Super responsive to any questions I had, Lola also gave me some great recommendations for places around the area that all turned out to be great. I would highly recommend Lola’s place to anyone looking for the real Parisian experience!",2018-04-02T11:07:09Z,5

3316596,2424053,Gi,This spot is really good. Its on the east side of Paris great local park and local venues. The place is right in the heart of the Art district and metro feet away. I know Paris a little so I had no problem. So its a good spot.,2015-05-26T18:00:25Z,5
3316596,3076282,Raul,"I really recommend this apartment. The host,  Malik,  is also very attentious. The price is justified. You have a pretty good space. The street Rue Jumin is a special one.  Diversity of food and markets. Two parks near that are the best on Paris. Buttes Chaumont and La Villette. 

Appartement well organized and cleant.",2015-06-25T14:06:33Z,5

29098411,2094679,Tom,This apartment is a great place from which to explore Paris. It’s very appealing and convenient to so much.  My friends were staying elsewhere but the Velib bikes have a station ride on the same street so I was able to commute quickly and cheaply to their neighborhood. This neighborhood is pretty charming itself. I also appreciated the little store next door for treats and beverages when I’d get in at night. I recommend this one.,2019-07-08T14:11:28Z,5

De nombreux bars, restaurants et épiceries font que l'indispensable est toujours à portée de main. Bref, nous recommandons sans hésitation !",2018-11-04T13:49:07Z,5
