Roman was a fantastic host The apartment was pristine and felt like a typical Parisian apartment very comfortable setting and very short walk to several interesting neighborhoods most famously Montmartre very convenient to Gare du Nord station and steps away from the metro to other touristic areas of Paris Roman was very communicative and he and his girlfriend do a fantastic job of making sure their guests have a great experience I would definitely choose this apartment again on future trips to Paris A small note The neighborhood is very lively and there is a lot of local activity around the apartment building into the night My friend and I did not feel in danger but females traveling alone may feel a bit uncomfortable going in out of the building like in any major city Inside the apartment itself it is very calm and quiet even with the windows open,A
My husband and I LOVED our stay at Simon s place The apartment looks exactly as pictured and the view is just incredible We loved waking up and going to bed with a view of the Eiffel tower The location is really great Easy to travel into the center of Paris by metro usually a min metro and the neighborhood is so neat Montmarte is full of artistic inspiration and history The apartment is situated on a perfect cobblestone alley near Vincent van Gogh s house you really feel like you re getting the Paris experience Plus we were pleasantly surprised to find that we were very close to amazing bakeries and restaurants and one of the best creperies in town The neighborhood always felt lively and safe which we appreciated Yes the apartment is located on the top floor and there are quite a few staircases to climb but we always welcomed the exercise after eating our way through the city we needed it The living room and bedroom have large windows that provided a wonderful fresh breeze We loved enjoying a glass of wine while looking at the Eiffel tower The place is nicely decorated with art and the floor to ceiling book shelves filled with books were so neat to peruse Bed was super comfy Shower was large and had great water pressure My husband enjoyed the Nespresso machine Simon was also a very generous host When our flight was early he let us check in much earlier than anticipated and he provided some of the best restaurant recommendations we had on our trip including an Italian restaurant just a minute walk from the apartment We feel like we totally lucked out and would definitely stay here again,A

Ok!,C
More well located near the heart of Paris and the boulevards Affordable and decorated with complete equipment for a long stay Less Some problems with the plumbing A little small for two people if you want to do something other than lie down and no nearby park for picnic,B
This is a great flat in a wonderful neighborhood Fantastic old building with lots of character but also updated quiet and in the back of the building far away from the busy street My only challenge with the experience was communication with Antoine he wasn t very responsive in advance of the reservation regarding meetup timing entering the apartment and then a last minute emergency prevented him from meeting me at the agreed upon time I can see from the other reviews that I am not the only guest who has had communication or meetup issues My suggestion would be to arrange a reliable backup plan such as hiding a lockbox in the entryway with the key and send the guests instructions for accessing the flat via the lockbox a week before the reservation so that guests can get inside in case of any problems Once I was in I was very glad to be there,B
i loved staying here it x s everything you need in an apartment it x s pretty big compared to paris standards too it x s in a more residential area but a quick metro gets you to everything you x re close to the lines they were so accommodating they were very quick with communication and they also allowed me to check in early i would love to stay here again,B

This is a superb area to stay in We walked everywhere from here The only time we used the metro was to go up to Montmartre We never came across an area apart from le Saint Louis that is where we thought we would prefer to be based A whole array of local artisan food shops to hand to suit all budgets and then ofcourse the rather expensive but excellent Le Bon March Rive Gauche with its grande epicerie de Paris m away on Rue de S vres S bastien is very laissez faire if you don t need him he s not there and if you do you just need to text phone or email him The road is a little noisy in the morning but the double glazing blocks it out if you like fresh air there are some smaller back windows you can open Overall a very easy comfortable and enjoyable stay,A

Julien s place is wonderful Decorated eclectically and fun we enjoyed spending our down time sitting with the windows open and having friends over for a glass or two in the spacious living room There is no AC or elevator to the third floor where the flat is but the charm of the architecture makes it totally worth it We preferred to enjoy local cafes and dining so the small kitchen didn t bother us The shower has awesome water pressure and shower head a definite bonus As American tourists visiting Paris this flat was a little far from where we spent our time The metro stop was a short walk and scooters available down the street which made transportation very accessible We enjoyed local cafes and restaurants in the neighborhood and hearing the school children each morning down the street In the future we would probably choose somewhere a little more central Julien is an excellent host communicating with you before during and after your stay He is friendly and inviting as is his home,A

Karine s apartment is an absolutely fantastic place to spend your vacation in Paris After staying in Paris for about days we found that her location was our favourite in the city not very touristy quiet EXCELLENT restaurants and cafes steps away close to bikes and public transportation etc The apartment itself is very spacious extremely clean and the decor is spot on you really feel like you are staying in a quintessential Parisian apartment If we come back to Paris this is absolutely where we would stay,A
This is a great spot if you want to be close to the metro and the tourist spots but also near places where actual parisians go We loved the light from the courtyard window The room was very small but not uncomfortable Definitely not the spot if you want to cook some stuff as the kitchen was non existant as advertised Go to the absinthe cafe around the corner for the hip vibe The bar L Attirail Caf for a cheap ass dive with absolutely delicious fried potatoes Nice place to stay,B

I am a bit disappointed with Juliette s efforts First after I already booked the apartment she asked me if her boyfriend s cat could stay there I was going to stay the following day and so I didn t want to look for another place at the last minute and I said it was fine However the cat was very freaked out that I was there and was spraying everywhere and I broke out in hives after sitting on the couch having only been in the apartment for minutes Also there was no internet I was traveling internationally and did not want to use my data which is expensive and my main requirement when looking for a place was to have a wifi connection Considering both of these things I asked for a discount which she said she would do and yet never did anything I am still waiting for a discount I will contact AirBnB,B
We have choosen the house of Aurelie because it looks cosy with dining table equiped kitchen WIFI and the location It is value for money We stayed with children who slept very well at the bed couch One of the best boulangers are around the corner together with other delicious food shops wine cheese roast chicken fish The neighbourhood is relaxed and not that touristic It is short walk to the centre of Montmartre Parking is a problem but you can park in parking for euro a day One critic remark is the bathroom their is no fence for the shower the shower is in a bath Thanks for staying in your house and the unforgetable holiday we had in Paris,A

Sylvain was an excellent host and his Paris apartment felt like home He even left me a few beers Communication Fast and reliable Sylvain made me feel comfortable Check In I appreciate them waiting for me since I got lost Directions were simple to follow from the airport but I took the wrong metro haha Value His flat is huge for Paris standards I x m coming from NYC so this was humongous for me I love that there was laundry in the flat and separate rooms for the living spaces Wifi is strong for WFH It x s a real two bedroom flat The guest room has a bunk bed and pull out mattress which could fit people if you had someone sleep on the living room couch Location Felt like a real local This is in a young artistic area It x s far enough away from the central area to not feel tourists but close enough to be walking distance to main attractions and metros The flat faces a busy street but I don x t mind city noises Price I felt the price was well marked for what you receive,A
Very nice apartment in an excellent location close to the Luxembourg Gardens In theory it is very convenient to get there on the RER from the airport but we were there during the strike where the line was facing major disruptions The apartment is roomy and filled with light Its cute garden backs onto the Val de Grace hospital Despite being on a pretty busy street the apartment is super quiet and secluded It was a little bit complicated to get the key from the hosting company involved retrieving and dropping key off at two separate laundromats but the company was very helpful and made the key exchange easier by sending someone to pick up key Overall we had a nice stay,B
I suggest everyone Messa is a superhost Location is awesome Thanks again,B

We have encountered a very friendly welcome A little welcome paper had been really useful giving all the informations needed by a guest especially when new to Paris The appartment looked exactly like the photos very spacious with much light from the big windows We liked the well equipped kitchen very much because it gave us the freedom of choice between a restaurant visit or cooking by ourselves which we did This is the general advantage of an appartment over a hotel room if it rains and sometimes it does rain even in Paris you can stay in the appartment and feel comfortably at home The bedroom is spacious too and the king size bed has room enough for two even without disturbing each other if that may be necessary By the way bed clothes and towels are provided and you don t have to care for the final cleaning The TV in the living room has access to at least international programs which comes very handy if you want to stay connected to news from your home country Highspeed WLAN is also available A maybe important feature for those who have security issues against Paris The appartment can only be reached via a metal grilled entrance which is always closed and supervised by a concierge From the balcony you have a marvellous view of Paris from Montparnasse to Pantheon The street looks beautiful from above with so many trees Most people don t think of a green Paris We have to admit that we do know the quarter since many years really well It is charming a wonderful mix of all kinds of people The Butte aux Caille can be easily reached by a little walk there are lots of bars cafes restaurants for every taste It s something of an in quarter too The Jardin du Luxembourg is near also the Jardin des Plantes For those who want to discover whole Paris the nearby Place d Italie gives access to three Metro lines the fastest way to go whereever you want e g it takes only minutes to the Eiffel tower For the gourmet fraction there are markets with really fresh products Of course you could also visit supermarkets or bakeries or butcher shops and a french specialty The so called traiteurs with their luxurious convenience food All in all it has been our most pleasant visit to Paris in the last years We would recommend an accommodation like this to anyone who loves Paris and who does not We are sure to be there next year again Thanks to Guillaume,A

Pierre s place was in a great location the street next to it was really lively filled with all kinds of restaurants and bars near it along with access to two subway lines and buses The unit looked just like the pictures and was very enjoyable However getting to the unit was a bit tricky as you had to go through a door a corridor another door up three flights of rickety steps and enter into a unit without a room number The unit itself was nice but getting in and out was a bit of a challenge Also the walls were fairly thin so it was a bit noisy at night But again great location,A

Florent s friend Aldric was gracious and responded to my requests very quickly The flat is modern and attractive as shown in the photos The rooms are a nice size larger than some Paris apartments Excellent shower excellent wifi comfortable sofa large dining room table good kitchen The neighborhood is very interesting and is definitely not in a tourist area much more like a true Parisienne experience There are many shops restaurants cafes and the metro within a short walking distance There were some things that detracted from my experience The UpBed pulls down from the ceiling and stays about cm above the floor It required me to climb up on a stool to get into and out of the bed That was very awkward The floor has four areas with ledges changes in floor height so I had to be careful not to trip The entrance to the apartment requires walking through a courtyard past eight smelly rubbish bins and part of the area isn t lighted at night The positive and negative aspects were about,B
Cyril is a very friendly and accommodating host His apartment is great comfortable and totally matching with the description and pictures The location is quiet close to the Parc des Buttes Chaumont less than minutes walk from the Pyrenees metro station Line which takes you in min to Chatelet the very center of Paris What I liked the most is the area a typical parisian district with plenty of nice food shops cafes and bars Maybe not on the tourist map but worth a visit to discover the real Paris,B

The day after our arrival, the entrance door of the apartment was stuck without cause, apparently that is what the person in charge of the apartment told us, which is why we lost more than half a day of our vacation until the situation was resolved. Given that at the time they did not charge us any repair costs, we were unpleasantly surprised when the owner claimed it from us days later at the time of our departure. There was no exchange. of words in bad terms with Capucine but Airbnb did intervene Each one made the pertinent defense and it was resolved that we guests did NOT have to pay the amount claimed. A shame this situation would have been a nice stay if it weren't for that",B

This is a wonderful and cozy flat on the rd floor of a lovely building on the edge of Pigalle and Montmartre Two Metro stops are nearby and also a number of great restaurants Walking to Montmartre Sacre Coeur is easy We much prefer this neighborhood to super touristy areas We loved Vrai Paris at the top of the hill for breakfast We especially appreciated Victoria x s flexibility with check in as our flight arrived at am Would stay here again in a heartbeat,A
We stayed here for days and this apartment was great It s a little south of the river about a minute walk but right on two metro lines and the RER train that goes to Charles de Gaulle airport so extremely convenient We had no problems getting around to all of the traditional tourist sites although since it is a bit further south we found that we never came back to the apartment to change clothes for something like a nicer dinner The apartment itself is very nice there is a large kitchen living area with TV sofa and kitchen table a good sized bedroom and separate shower and toilet areas All in all very cute very comfortable very clean everything you would need for a short stay The apartment is on the second floor European second floor so third floor in the US and there is no elevator just something to keep in mind if you aren t good with stairs or have very heavy luggage In terms of neighborhood there is a terrific bread pastry shop right on the corner and a great street with lots of stores specializing in bread cheeses meats and fruit nearby The Catacombs are a minute walk and the Montparnasse cemetery is about a minute walk Camille herself is wonderful She is extremely responsive she confirmed the booking the same day we requested it and a few days before we arrived in Paris she sent detailed instructions on how to get to the apartment She was out of town so she arranged for a friend to let us in and give us final instructions on letting ourselves out of the apartment at the end of the trip Camille had left for us a map of the neighborhood and instructions on everything we might need while in the apartment where the clean sheets were how to use the TV etc and also given us small tourist guides for Paris a bottle of wine and a bag of French nougat amazing She even cleared out a few shelves in her closet so we would have room for our clothes and let us know we could use any of the cooking staples she had at the house saving us from having to buy basics like oil seasonings butter etc She really went out of her way to make our stay comfortable without even being there,A
Bonjour Anne Marie is a fantastic host and the apartment is wonderful I spent a total of nights and my stay couldn t be better The apartment is very quaint clean and made me feel like I was at home The location in Montmartre is perfect being located with minutes walk to different metro stops Anne Marie goes the extra mile There was a bottle of wine some bread jams and water upon my arrival I had a wonderful stay and I would highly recommend this flat to anyone traveling to Paris Bon journee Jason,B

Edouard s flat was the perfect base on my recent trip to Paris The flat was presently spotless with all amenities that anyone would ever need I especially liked how I could use the Smart TV to login to my Netflix account when it was raining The kitchen is well stocked with equipment pots and pans so cooking was easy The flat was as shown in all the pictures and was well furnished The bed was certainly innovative but beware that it is still quite high m even when lowered so not one for those prone to falling out of bed in the night I found the apartment easily after a minute walk from Gare du Nord The nearby canal makes a lovely walk into the centre of Paris or the nearby Parc de la Villette and I made use of the Velib bike hire nearby to easily get into the centre There is a largely segregated cycle route that runs alongside the canal and into the centre About metres from the apartment block is a Franprix mini market which I found useful for all the basic supplies that you will need when self catering There is also a butcher and bakery amongst others on the same street I was shown around the flat on my arrival my Edouard s friend but I had been in contact with Edouard via the Airbnb app from when I booked to when I arrived I also had to check out early so unfortunately did not get to meet Edouard I felt sure that had I had any issues that Edouard would have tried his best to sort them out I would have no hesitation in recommending this apartment to individuals or couples looking for a roomy and excellent value alternative to a regular hotel stay in Paris Excellent value for money,A
The apartment is beautiful as shown in the pictures very sunny and absolutely well located All around the area is plenty of bars and restaurants and the fact that the apartment is on the last floor makes it very quiet One recommendation I x d like to give you is to provide the apartment with a closet a coffee maker more pots too cook or boil water and a place where to let them dry The apartment also needs a great cleaning in order to become more comfortable and livable One more thing it could be convenient to remove all the personal belongings from the apartment like pictures of friends and various objects that are not useful for guests and make it feel like someone else x s home Thank you,A

The location of this apartment is Amazing We had read all the great reviews before we booked the place but being unfamiliar with the layout of Paris we still weren t prepared for what a great location this is It is directly on the Rue de Rivoli which is right next to the Sein River just across the Tullieries gardens and the apartment is right next to the Louvre And the Metro line is literally about feet from the apartment There are tons of restaurants and shops in the streets below the apartment And I can t say enough good things about Olimpia and Patrik her freind who was there to check out out and help us get our taxi on the last morning Olimpia always answered my text messages and calls promptly and she showed us the view from her apartment just across the hallway from the rented apartment both when we first got there and then again at night The view from her apartment is amazing and you are literally looking at the Tullieries gardens the Louvre and the Eiffel Tower The apartment itself if very comfortable At first it seemed small based on American standards but as we got settled in we realized that it was plenty big enough for us There is a comfortable bed sufficient closet space a nice bathroom and a small kitchenette Although we didn t cook any real meals the kitchenette was great for keeping drinks cold making coffee and tea supplied by Olimpia and making breakfast usually bagettes and cheese ham etc from the corner store just a block away Olimpia also provides a hair dryer and an iron and ironing board so you don t need to bring those,A

Great apartment much larger and brighter than expected Two disappointments were the neighborhood and abundace of personal belongings that crowded in on us The immediate three block area is upscale but it is a gentrified island in the middle of much less desireable neighborhoods on all sides As far as personal items the owner left notes and warnings not to touch his things rather than appropriately clear out the apartment The kids bedroom and master closet were locked off with chains and with a minimum of effort all personal items could have been taken out of the way by putting them there There was no closet space for hanging clothes,B

L a is a great host She was very attentive and picked up the phone immediately when I didn x t know how to find the right name on the electronic doorbell We asked her questions on several occasions during our stay and she was always quick to respond The apartment is beautifully and tastefully decorated with a mix of European style furniture modern art work stacks of books and some African touches like fabrics used in decorative pillows art work etc reflecting the area x s multicultural vibe I bought some beautiful wax fabrics in the shops in the area The apartment is spacious especially the living dining room and has a separate bedroom with a double bed don x t expect king size this is a beautiful old building so a king size bed would barely fit there It x s more like a queen size I would guesstimate The bed is comfortable though a little soft for my liking being used to a very sturdy mattress The kitchen is fairly small but it x s laid out efficiently and is well equipped so you could cook a full meal there without any issues if you wanted to We did have issues cleaning up because we couldn x t find any dish towels perhaps an oversight in the last cleaning session Speaking of cleaning the apartment was very clean I have severe dustmite allergies and I did not have to take any extra medication while there which is very rare when I don x t bring my allergy covers for the bedding The bathroom like in most homes from this era is tiny it x s built into what for American homes would be a smallish walk in closet I x m a little over x x and I x m about a European size American size to and I can imagine if you x re much bigger you x d have problems maneuvering between the toilet the tiny sink and the door The shower works well Of course in a building this age you don x t have much room to work with We did have an issue with the toilet seat that was caused by the previous guests and unfortunately L a had not been able to fix it before we arrived She was very open and apologetic about it and we didn x t mind too much She mentioned that she was meeting a contractor on the day of our departure to discuss improvements for the apartment so I imagine the place will be even lovelier for the next guests The apartment is a wonderful reprieve from the busy city It is located close to a very lively shopping area with lots of international shops and a small market The latter unfortunately does cause some trash to be left on the street in the area which is a shame because the buildings are lovely on the inside But don x t let that deter you from staying at this lovely apartment The shop keepers and the people in the area were all very lovely and welcoming and the place is only about a minute walk from the Sacr Coeur and Montmartre I wouldn x t be surprised if this turns out to be the next up and coming neighborhood in Paris,A

????????,C
Everything was as good as it seems on the pictures and as described Audrey and Vannak were very kind and helpful with the stay We also had the chance to use the baby bed and an extra mattress for the kids The apartment is more than big excellent compared to other opportunities in Paris for that value The area is ok close to Le Marais which is very nice but to reach the main attractions and Seine you must take public transport or have a long walk It was a pleasure to stay in a home where people actually live and that is not meant to make money,B

It was a great experiencing from all sides of views starting with our check in arrangements through our whole stay and ending with a perfect check out The apartment itself is very quiet probably the most quiet we have ever been in Paris The place is sparkling clean and everything looks position just at the right place We greatly recommend Alice s apartment for couples who would like to visit Paris The only downside was rather poor quality of internet connection,A
The apartment overall was beautiful and large however a few items to note Pros Bed and bedding was amazing Great location Spacious Heating worked well with heated towel rail Good internet and TV setup Ben was a very welcoming host Cons There appears to be much more furniture in the photos I e there is no kitchen table or second couch Kitchen cleanliness was not great The kitchen lacked necessities only two cups and no wine glasses Shower was not fantastic a little tricky to wash your hair and not flood the bathroom,A
Victoire was really gentle and helpful from the very first moment answering to our requests very fast and possitive She even bought for us bread when I asked her to as we were arriving quite late We were inexpectely much later as expected and didn t manage to call her But she took care and called us and waited patiently to our delayed arrival and received us with her very warm welcome The appartment is just as shown in the photos clean and accesible very calm located I would certainly recommend it Just to mention one little inconvenience we missed some curtains in the bedroom to preserve some privacy and have some darker light in the very early hours But I guess it is not such a big issue to solve Merci nouveau Victoire et bon boyage a Cuba,B
The room was as described and the location was good The person who initially met us was friendly and gave us a thorough tour before we got settled in Unfortunately there was no wi fi though it was guaranteed in the description As travelers it was crucial for us to have this amenity as we needed it to plan both our time in Paris as well as beyond Communication from Houssen was almost non existent and the few instances were sent through means which he obviously knew we did not have access to so we ended up spending a hugely significant sum of money time and energy that we didn t have on finding wifi at caf s and restaurants rather than experiencing the city or even the restaurants Overall the lack of communication follow through on promises and accountability added extra pressure on us that ended up compromising our stay In the end he offered to compensate us and sent us for the trouble Based on all the additional costs and stress we do not recommend paying to jump through hoops with Houssen,B
Had a great time at Linda s place It was very cute inside and the pictures almost don t do it justice Linda was a great host very available to help up work out the wifi and washing machine She had recommendations of things to do nearby as well as more practical help You can see the Moulin Rouge from the front door and at night we were pretty excited to be able to see the Eiffel Tower from the bedroom window And the fourth floor walk up was good exercise,A
A great place to stay it x s quite big and everything we needed was in there the communication with the owner was also very good and she is very friendly Overall a big yay to stay at her place The only thing I wished it was there is a lift LOL,B

Alice is very kind and fast to respond when you need something The apartment is lovely and I was so pleased with how quiet it is Even though it is very central and in a lively neighborhood the windows face inner courtyards keeping out most of the city noise The bed is pretty comfortable for a sofa bed The shower has good pressure The wifi works well The one strange thing is that there is no kitchen trash can which I ve never encountered before in an Airbnb Also it appears to be someone s full time residence because there is a lot of food in the kitchen and no real storage space to unpack a bag or store your own food It was fine for me because I was alone and just kept my cereal and bread and such on the counter in the kitchen but if you are coming for longer and hoping to have some cabinet space make sure to ask the host she is lovely so I assume she would make some space for you if you need it,A

Thanks for the excellent stay Ugo Your place was perfect for my wife and my romantic day getaway to Paris We loved the location at the foot of the hills of Montmartre and your place was very inviting and comfortable for our stay Kassaundra was wonderful in giving us great advice for touring around the local area We absolutely loved the advice to walk south from your place to get great fresh squeezed juices and tasty food and to walk north up the hill to check out the amazing Sacre C x oeur and the Place du Tertre These are both an absolute MUST see and scream what I would guess is quintessential Paris We absolutely loved our stay at your place Thank you for informing us in advance that most buildings in Paris don x t have an elevator We got used to it quite quickly given the many stairs that we climbed in the area around Montmartre and the monuments of Paris in general STARS for your place your hosting and your location and Stars for Paris If only all the smokers would move away That was our only issue with Paris but this has zero to do with your place Just a fact about Paris and I guess it gives it even more unique charm Thanks again Ugo for a wonderful romantic stay in Paris,A
Loved S bastien s appartment As an Australian couple and our th visit to Paris this appartment has been the best experience and as close to the Paris you see in the films without the hordes of tourists The photos are accurate and it was wonderful having a bright airy living room with a lounge overlooking the street This was a last minute change of plan for us but S bastien was incredibly quick to respond and so there were no dramas and it couldn t have gone more smoothly if we had booked weeks in advance The neighbourhood is vibrant but the street is very quiet at night so no problems with sleeping or noise but all the upside of wonderful restaurants and brasseries in the street And the cake shop Mamie Gateaux just doors away was heaven Luxemburg Gardens are an easy walk and we even walked to Mus e D Orsay comfortably We only stayed nights on this trip but S bastien s appartment would be suitable for a long term stay as well Just the one flight of stairs and no elevator but the stairs are wide and easy to navigate Wifi worked well and no problem with connection Definitely stay here again when we are in Paris and the neighborhood street is by far the most we have enjoyed of the times we have been in Paris Thankyou S bastien,A

Stephanie s space in the heart of the Marais has a lot of character and is set in a fantastic location She has clearly made enormous efforts to make her guests stays as enjoyable as possible from a very convenient check in out to lovely little touches throughout the apartment In particular the beautiful living area with natural light and stylish decor feel very warm and welcoming The location could also not be more convenient for those who enjoy the food bars and shopping of the surrounding area Stephanie is also a great communicator and was always very quick to respond we really appreciated her hospitality Two things to point out to guests are that the apartment is on the th floor with no lift so ensure you travel light Also the bedroom has a number of wooden beams in the ceiling that mean you need to watch your head tall people should consider this Otherwise I would highly recommend Stephanie s apartment for those looking for a stylish space with lots of character in a very central Paris location,A

"Fr d rique's apartment is very well located and comfortably and charmingly furnished. Communication with Fr d rique worked perfectly, she responded quickly and was very flexible regarding check-in, which is always a big plus when traveling in a city. The apartment is in a very Good area easily accessible by public transport and also close to some Vlib stations. The busier streets of the Marais are within walking distance and the alleys directly around the apartment also have some restaurants, an excellent bakery and a weekly market The bed was very comfortable, everything needed was available in the kitchen and bathroom. Unfortunately, the apartment is a bit bright. So when the neighbors are partying on Saturday evening, you can hear some of the conversations and music. However, this only happens once in the evening If this was the case, it is probably the exception and therefore negligible. Overall, we had a very nice stay with Fr d rique",B

???????,C
The apartment itself is as described Very clean good location and all the basic things you would need A few things to note It is on the th floor with no elevator Not a big deal for us but just good to know Also there are cafes right out in front that are very loud until late at night a m It didn t really both us as we live in a loud and busy city and we are night people Closing the front window blocked the noise very well but it was a hot weekend so closing the window also blocked the nice breeze that otherwise would flow through the apartment We had to choose between quiet or a cool apartment could not have both A fan would be nice Finally the bed was not very comfortable as it sinks in the middle and made for not the most restful night Overall though we enjoyed the experience,A
Very nice quiet apartment,C
Lingzhen met us at the apartment when we arrived showed us a few things The pictures are accurate The apartment is bright modern comfortable The stairway leading up to the second floor is dark musty smelling but honestly it added to the old city feel But the appartment itself is newly renovated It was quite hot out about degrees and the apartment was very hot at night We couldn t leave the windows open all night because of the traffic noise below not terrible but enough to wake you up Lingzhen immediately bought two fans which helped a great deal The neighbourhood feels safe welcoming It is very close to the Luxembourg RER station making it very easy to get virtually anywhere in Paris We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here would book it again without a second thought Highly recommended,A
Tidy comfortable little apartment Good value for money Would recommend,C
"Quentin was a remarkable Host Listening and very available His apartment is very pleasant, quiet and very bright To recommend",B
We had a decent time at Loic s place The price was good for the time we were there and the locations and views of the city were really stunning There were a few things to note there was no hair dryer and only French TV so if you visit be sure and bring something to access netflix or your own shows if you aren t French This may not bother some but you are staying in someones home when they are not there so expect lots of kids toys personal photos and kids drawings on the walls in the bedroom For a romantic vacation it felt a little like staying at our cousins house and not like a rental as you may expect Overall it was a good place if you are there to explore and not spend a lot of time in the room Expect flights of stairs on a tight spiral staircase as well this wouldn t be ideal for anyone with issues with stairs I know stairs are listed but these are some STAIRS,B

Juliette told us to be there before pm as she has other engagements so we rushed to the place by taking an expensive Uber from the train terminal but end up waiting by the street for more than an hour under hot sun During that one hour we couldn t reach Juliette on the phone at all no pick up so it was quite worrying and we weren t sure what to do we had our luggage with us so we couldn t go anywhere either When Juliette finally got back to us she mentioned she had some trouble and asked us to wait for a further few hours with several more delays She originally suggested that we wait a few hours then take an Uber to collect the keys from another location from someone else but we suggested that we will wait nearby At that point Juliette wasn t too helpful as she also complained about our arrival time despite what was agreed beforehand The few hours waiting was very stressful as Juliette wasn t responsive and it was my first time in Paris everything was quite foreign to me We also missed our tour which we originally planned for that afternoon and sat in a nearby restaurant waiting for hours The restaurant owner didn t seem happy with us too as our luggage were in the way in the tiny restaurant space Juliette did apologise at the end and agreed to reimburse our salad from the restaurant as compensation for the long wait but I haven t received any news reimbursement on this until now About the apartment be prepared to climb five levels of narrow and winding stairs to the top floor no elevators and dimly lit I couldn t get my luggage up on my own without risking injury and grateful that I m traveling with a friend so we took turn to help each other out took us at least mins and lots of hard work to get our luggage up and down Host wasn t there to help Juliette s sister turned up to pass us the keys after the long wait and left immediately after Upon arriving in the house the bed wasn t made and we had a sight of the yellowish mattress and pillows We had to make our own bed and Juliette wanted guests to remove the pillow covers bed sheet and quilt cover before leaving so make sure to budget some time for this in your travel schedule Apart from everything the apartment is stylish with Parisian features small balcony and nice lighting and it is in a trendy area of Paris Voltaire near to the Metro Station,B

This is a gorgeous apartment in an absolutely perfect location and we really appreciated the personal touches that Ad la de gave to the experience From the first email Ad la de was warm and welcoming She and her partner met us at the apartment and they were very helpful and friendly yet respectful of the fact that we only had a short time in Paris Her place is even more beautiful than in the pictures It is very comfortable with different spaces to spread out in not all confined in one x room x and it has been decorated in an absolutely charming original manner x I wish my place at home looked more like Ad la de x s The rain shower is incredible x it x s worth renting this place just for the shower Comfortable bed great internet inspiring decorative touches It x s only one short flight of stairs up and the windows open onto a quiet courtyard The apartment is perfectly nestled in a quiet safe neighbourhood between the Butte Montmartre and walking access to the metro At the end of the block the stairs take you right up to Sacr Coeur we loved the fact that we could wander through Montmartre late into the evening and then our apartment was just steps away There is a caf and an excellent bakery nearby The metro which is only a minute walk away is a key line for accessing the major attractions of Paris and is also the one you need for the Gare du Nord and the airport This was our first AirBnB experience and it makes us want to never stay in a hotel again Thank you Ad la de and Rodrigo,A
The building is scary specially if you coming night time inside the apartment is a lot different then how its displayed in the pictures,C
The stay went very well Mathieu,C
Alexis and Charlotte made us feel totally welcome they contacted us four days prior to our arrival with instructions to enter the building etc as they were away As soon as we arrived there were instructions on house things like wifi and heating and a lovely bottle of wine to welcome us Really we were touched We messaged them to ask where the towels were and they responded straight away As hosts they were top The apartment was a PERFECT location and we actually looked at the hotel prices down the road and it was over to stay a night in just a in that area so we were really impressed My experience of Airbnb is you get two types of apartments the first is someones home that they have allowed you to enter briefly the second is someones second home that has perhaps less of a lived in feel This apartment is defiantly the first a relaxed and warm couples cosy home overlooking the rooftops of Paris We d stay again Lovely,A

Stephanie s place was unreal Our first time in Paris and it couldn t have been more a perfect stay The apt had SO MUCH character and charm the exposed wood beams and little nooks not to mention the sky lights The entire space was filled with little sky lights and the living room was breathtaking with the sunlight streaming through the colored pains Even listing to the rain pitter pattering on the glass it was a perfectly romantic We loved the stylish decor and my personal favorite was the large bathtub tucked in the corner The location was very convenient right in Le Marais walking distance to lots of cool bars speakeasies cafes vintage shops and restaurants Also near the Picasso Museum and Atelier Brancusi which I was dying to see Definitely a hike up some stairs she warned us and I was totally fine figured it would be a good way to work off all the croissants I ate but I think my boyfriend counted stairs haha so just know before booking Would definitely stay again,A

thanks,C
I m beginning this review with the fact that I m not a clean freak and I absolutely loathe cleaning This place took the cake though especially as people are PAYING to stay in it I arrived early evening from London Had to pick up keys from a nearby pub Walked to the apartment and after letting myself in I thought someone else was in there as the smell of cigarette smoke was so fresh After opening the windows on both sides of apartment the smell vanished a bit I saw the ashtray out one of the windows so the smell had definitely come from someone recently smoking it in the apartment The bedroom Oh I wish I could post the photos I took The bed was unmade which I thought was strange Upon closer inspection it looked as though the sheets had been slept in and hadn t been changed in over a month GROSS Couldn t find any others to replace them either Just pulled them off and slept on a sarong I had in my suitcase with another sarong on top and then the blanket the blanket cover hadn t been washed in a very long time too YUCK The bathroom Hair all over the floor No clean towels to use the towels had obviously been used many times and had been left there to dry they had a funny smell to them so had to basically drip dry after the shower The shower hasn t had a good scrub in many months Black mould in the grout that I could wipe off with my finger The kitchen and living room were lovely though Looks like the kitchen was fairly new hence no time to get dirty yet There were some dirty cups left in the sink though All in all it was not a great experience It doesn t matter if it s cheap or if people are only staying one night it still needs to be relatively clean It doesn t matter if the sheets or towels are old they still need to be clean Preferably no smoking inside and leaving the windows closed also not a great start when you walk into a room with a very strong smoke smell A definitely bachelor pad that needs to either be cleaned up or not available for rent on AirBnB,B
"Welcoming host, very nice accommodation and ideally located, however the cleaning really leaves something to be desired",B
Well located in Paris in the city center There is everything you need in the apartment which is a big plus Very comfortable bedding However the common areas are not in good condition at all It remains a Parisian apartment you can hear everything that is there happens in the neighboring apartments and on the stairs Moreover these are in very poor condition steps not straight and very narrow very complicated with a suitcase or when you go back and forth a lot on my floor without elevator It is also a noted that a priori the cleaning team or someone else with the keys to the apartment entered the accommodation during my absence during my stay which seems very problematic to me. In s had obviously nothing to do with it and the discussion has always been very smooth with her,B
Our stay at Gautier x s place was good Gautier had advised us that there were building works before we came but we still decided to book The building noise is not a problem if you are getting up early to explore Paris the noise started at about am so if you are planning on getting out early it is ok Gautier was very quick to respond to any questions or queries There are metros and buses within walking distance which makes it easy to get around Paris My only small advice for staying at the apartment would to be to bring some slippers for your feet as the floor is very hard,B
Our stay at Seynep s apartment was excellent She was very careful in every detail as well as being very friendly and welcoming The apartment is very stylish and cozy It was very clean It is very close to the metro and a market which greatly facilitates our stay It was all very good,A

I stayed in the apartment for six nights and it was easy to feel like it was home I arrived in the middle of a heat wave and was worried about being on the top floor with no air conditioning but because of the big windows in every room I was quite comfortable Everything was very clean the linens were very soft and the kitchen had everything I needed and more for cooking in As was expected from reading other reviews there was some noise from the school in back in the morning and the caf and bar in the front at night especially because the windows needed to be wide open for cool sleeping But it was easily managed with ear plugs I am sad to be leaving so soon and hope this place is available next time I x m in Paris,A
The place was nice and quite spacious for Paris and a great location Unfortunately however Frederique the host was incredibly rude At check in she was quite aggressive and not welcoming at all even though we were quite accommodating to her endless list of rules During the stay she was not responsive she gave the wrong Wifi information and only fixed them a day later At checkout she asked to do the checkout late which we happily accommodated through a friend of ours Even though we left the place absolutely spotless and were accommodating she was extremely rude to my friend and was unnecessarily paranoid about her rules without a shred of evidence and made us feel incredibly uncomfortable It x s unfortunate given the place but I would not recommend dealing with her,B

This was the perfect spot to spend a week solo The proximity to the R publique metro stop meant that everything felt close by though Paris is so walkable I didn x t take it all that much The few times I came back from exploring in the middle of the day I really enjoyed all the light in the apartment thanks to a big window and skylight While the apartment is technically small the layout makes it feel bigger and it felt like more than enough space for for me It probably would have been just as comfortable with a partner As some other reviews note there is a lively bar downstairs and people gather there till late It didn x t bother me but if you x re sensitive to noise pack accordingly Already scheming to return and stay here again ASAP,B

On the plus side it s super bright and cheerful the bathroom is tiny but great the washing machine was a huge plus and though the wifi didn t work while I was there Elsa very considerately gave me a discount in cash She s super nice but the apartment needs some work Things to know on the con side This apartment is in a building that keeps its trash just inside the door so any time you enter or exit the building you re greeted with a cloud of garbage and bugs The apartment itself is clean although it s much more cluttered than you can see in the photos the bed is surrounded by open closets so you re sleeping in a closet basically I definitely felt like a student borrowing someone s dorm room for the weekend There s no fan or method of air circulation aside from the open windows so my choice was to either get the night sweats or listen to people partying up and down the block I heard several terrible renditions of Wannabe from a surprising variety of drunk French people between the hours of and am and one hilarious version of I feel like a woman but I would have rather been asleep I found the bed incredibly uncomfortable though I suppose that is a personal preference The host is really nice and I hate to write a negative review but the above factors made this place generally unpleasant to stay at if only because even with earplugs in it was impossible to get a full night s sleep at any point Three stars for the price,A

The apartment looks exactly as in the pictures It s spacious with a beautiful bay of tall windows opening up to a little strip of balcony The coffee table you see in the living room picture can become a dining table with extensions seating up to people It is clearly the apartment of someone who lives in it Don t expect a corporate apartment It has its advantages there are the essentials to cook with the pots and pans are of good enough quality you don t have to start from scratch You will also see the belongings of the owner but Fran ois was fine with my moving things around to store my stuff Checking in was easy and Fran ois is extremely responsive The building stands at the end of an enclave off Avenue Mozart therefore it is very quiet The location is ideal between Ranelagh and La Muette Metro stations very close to great food stores and supermarkets cafes fine restaurants and the park It s a posh safe and clean area of Paris We had a wonderful stay and will choose to come back to this place again next time,A

The apartment is located in a nice area but unfortunately due to the lack of cleanliness the cat hair everywhere and smell in the kitchen and the host misleading description of this as a non pet friendly listing even tho there has clearly been pets in the house i had to cut my trip short due to a severe allergic reaction because of the amount of cat hair on the bed specifically and i have spent the rest of my trip which was for my birthday in the hospital due to her negligence to not list this has a pet friendly space her refusal to have a cleaning services throughly clean the apartment so i could continue my stay and the all around griminess of the apartment i would not recommend there are defintely better places to stay for a fraction of the price and that will not put your well being in danger,B

This apartment is a lovely light filled classic French floor apartment on a quiet street in a pretty accessible part of town Common in older homes the floors squeak and the home is decorated with small accessories like any loved home that one has to be careful not to accidentally brush into Overall a nice place to stay Never met Lo c the check in out was through a restaurant down the street that had the key Kind of strange but when we had questions we got a response within a day from the host Better to bring your own amenities like soap and lotion and for the ladies there is no hairdryer provided Basic needs meet So if your up for a steep climb up flights of stairs this is probable the place for you just don x t forget anything downstairs,B

Nice little apartment in Bastille very close to line Very cozy and under the roofs Keep in mind that the flat is on the th floor if you are not more young or a bit off shape it could be a bit fatiguing If you are like me I am but I live on th floor without elevator all is fine There is everything in the flat for a short stay all equipped microwave shower tea and coffee all nice and clean The flat is used by the owner so keep it in mind there a few cupboards locked for privacy not everything could be used by guests I think There is not TV I have no TV in my home so for me it s a plus but in Paris if you need TV to pass your days there is something wrong with you Saturday evening is a bit noisy but hey Paris is Paris but on the th floor the noise is actually far I slept well The other days are perfectly fine All considered a nice stay,A

Highly recommended staying at J r my x s place not only for being a great host but also for a fantastic location The metro line is literally a minute walk away and other lines are easily accessible from there as well J r my x s flat is simple and minimalist but suited us perfectly We stayed for nights and found the Parisian flat more than delightful and airy There is a mini ring hob but not an oven so for longer stays nights it x s worth knowing as it made us eat out more not always a bad thing but we would have certainly liked to cook a nice meal one evening but it was limited The flat is located on a rd floor which is accessed by stairs alone but this is more than manageable and wasn x t an inconvenience The flat itself is located on a little side road with minimal noise disruption The flat has a small courtyard behind a locked door to the street which we really loved and made the flat seem even more secluded and intimate Overall would highly recommend,A

Communication and check in with Gaelle was great she was thorough in giving us instructions for her apartment and patient with our fluctuating arrival time The place is small but is cosy for two people It is heavily decorated with interesting art and nice color schemes there is not much counter space to put your things although Gaelle made space in her closets for clothes and such The bed is comfortable the internet is fast The apartment appears clean on the surface but actually it is not so clean dirty carpet in the living room and in the kitchen dirty shelves drawers dishes and cutlery with spots of food dingy pots and pans they were rusty I spent almost two hours cleaning on the first day plus had to clean the vacuum cleaner first so that I could use it We are not at all clean freaks by the way But as we were there for days I was expecting to be able to cook some meals but the state of the kitchen made this very unappealing It was starting to get cold outside and unfortunately the heater was not working so the apartment got quite cold on some nights The towel heater in the bathroom works but is not enough to heat the whole place It was nice to have a clothes washer but be aware it takes a long time it seems to be an older model Location is great Very close to bus which brings you directly to Gare du Nord perfect for Charles de Gaulle airport connections Also the metro Jourdain is a minute walk away Two beautiful parks at your fingertips Buttes Chaumont and Belleville its a great place to be Also there is a small grocery store opposite the apartment very handy Having an elevator is a plus and it was an amazingly quiet one too couldn t hear it at all even though is it right outside of the apartment Being on the second floor means it is noisy from the street traffic but that dies down from around midnight to am All in all we had a good stay but were dismayed by the state of the cleanliness in the kitchen Not the best value in our opinion,A
Claire was very helpful and she responded to every single question immediately She is really sweet The place is very nice clean lots of storage for your clothes The neighborhood is just great The apartment windows face the interior court so it is quiet like in a country side however in the block you can find places from the fanciest and a very nice vegetarian place to the cheapest and coolest you can find in Paris Nice min walk to Galeries Lafayette different metro stations are very close bio grocery store min walk and a Carrefour on the corner of the street opened till pm rare thing in Paris I come to Paris several times a year for my studies so will definitely book this place for my next stay,A

Olimpia s place is in a great location with a great view At first it seems small but I ve come to realize this is typical of Paris apartments She did not misrepresent its size or anything in my opinion She was very welcoming gracious kind and professional On our last night we noticed a leak from the shower I notified her and informed her I was stepping out and I didn t mind if someone repaired it while we were out She had someone repair it almost immediately and when I returned there was no sign anyone had entered besides the fast repair It should be noted that the washer and dryer are not located in the unit but that is not a problem There are locked doors to enter the apartment and I placed my laundry in a bag between the doors at her suggestion When I returned they were in the same spot washed dried and neatly folded Thank you Olimpia,A

The location is perfect for staying in Le Marais You are right in the middle with lots of trendy shops bars cafe and places to eat Just as the pictures the room is small Fine for one person and ok for two if you are ok with confined spaces The central heating was great was snowing while we stayed but room was very warm One wall looked like it was being treated for mould but no smell so fine Just needed to be painted white to match the rest of the flat The flat is up two floors of stairs with no lift This added to the character of the building but bare in mind if lots of luggage or trouble with stairs There is a small fridge extremely cold plates cutlery to use A plug in stove if needed but I would suggest if you need a kitchen while staying this flat is not the one There are great places to eat in the area bring money as all very expensive My only negative is the temperature of the shower water if you like a warm hot shower The water got warm for a quick dash in the shower Tips for the area Le Perla bar for the fashion crowd and good priced drinks La Pick Clops for food Wine at La Belle Hortense Morning pastries and sandwiches have breakfast here too Boulangerie de Rennes Delicious,B

I had the most tremendous stay at Alexandre s apartment While it is true the space is quite compact it is also beautifully finished and I found was just the right size for the independent traveller There s an espresso machine in the apartment which saved me plenty of euro every day the light is lovely and it is a very quick walk to Shakespeare and Company a large part of why I was back in Paris Do note that there is a private toilet separate from the apartment so you must enter and exit the apartment with your keys in order to use the facilities which I never found to be an issue There is also an elevator up a small flight of stairs so you don t have to carry your luggage to the top of the building but would not be accessible for those in a wheelchair or with very limited mobility When I fell ill with bronchitis Alexandre s family even brought me soup some home remedies and shared some extra chocolate cake they had when I was feeling better He is very communicative and prompt in his responses to set up bookings or when I had trouble with the wifi I quickly felt very at home in the space I would absolutely stay here again,A

Camille s apartment exudes retro chic and is a brilliant place to stay you have everything you need both in the apartment and in the neighbourhood As the other reviews say it is actually a minute away from the m tro and seconds away from as many bars restaurants and food shops as you could hope to find We particularly enjoyed the French Bastards bakery just round the corner but you are spoiled for choice We would also recommend Peppe Pizzeria at the top of the Rue des Martyres Unlike many Parisian apartments there is a lift one of the world s smallest which is a boon after a long day seeing the sights The very many bars and clubs in the area can mean it is loud at night in Pigalle but because Camille s bedroom is behind the living room you can sleep undisturbed It is a real privilege to get to stay in someone s home like this and we can t recommend it highly enough Thank you,A

We had a really enjoyable stay for a week in May The apartment is mostly as the pictures show Had everything we needed including iron and ironing board The shower has hot water and the pressure is perfect It was a bit cold during our stay and there is no heating controlled from the apartment But the cover made up for that during the evening Some small downsides The toilet space is very small depending on your size it might pose a challenge to use it Not unusable just challenging Also the toilet space has no ventilation The shower is in the same room as the bedroom see pics No issue for us bear in mind depending on who you share with The area is great open air market with fruits veggies seafood and tons of pastries Full of shops restaurants and boulangeries not touristy Close to metro stations and to Parc Monceau Justine was great kept in touch replied quickly to questions and the communication went smoothly Key from hotel nearby w h service,B
The location was excellent We would like to rate it higher but there was a problem with the water heater from the start of our stay that made our visit difficult Nicolas responded quickly each time I communicated that we had no hot water but was unable to secure a plumber to repair replace it We settled on a refund for this inconvenience,B
The place is grandiose Pristine Very clean The interior intellectual and inspiring Creative solutions away from the mainstream suffocating us everywhere thats why I prefer Airbnb Still a rare find Playfully decorated with many precious little pieces of art and rare publishings It is much more beautiful than on the photos A place I would wish to own The house is very safe The neighbourhood vibrant The cleaning lady gave us a very warm welcome and Sarah tailored recommendations along our interests All the insider tips what is happening right now you otherwise never know It is a stay you want to leave a nice present or flowers behind Thank you so much,A

Jenna s friends met me on arrival and explained the basics to me and Jenna left a list of her favorite restaurants etc which was helpful The apartment is quite large and seems to be very much based on her personality and is obviously her home rather than a commercial let The location is fairly very central and convenient and in one of Paris s oldest areas which had great appeal I think that some people will love this apartment,B

Clara s apartment was lovely and clean a nice big space with a good sized living room dining area and kitchen and separate double bedroom more than big enough for me and plenty of space for a couple or family Clara was a great host very accommodating and helpful The information such as the wifi code etc was all laid out very clearly in a welcome book The apartment had lots of security with door codes to get into the building The location was good for me as I could walk to Nation in about minutes and get the direct line to Concorde where I was working every day I would definitely recommend staying at Clara s apartment,A

I wanted to stay in a place where when you walk out into the street you felt you were in Paris with things to do restaurants and shops This AirBNB exceeded those expectations with the location and the view from the apartment After settling in we did not have to venture more than yards to encounter a wine bar tapas restaurant Olivier is the owner a craft beer pub bakery and grocery store Beyond these steps there was so much to explore and easy to get around The host was responsive to any questions There was a lovely view from these windows down the street and when the windows were shut there was no noise There was another window to an interior courtyard by the bed Lovely stay,A
Both Chris and her place are wonderful I spent nearly two weeks in her home and it is incredibly charming very clean very comfortable and quiet It has a nice view lots of indoor plants and the decor is lovely It really has everything you need too Chris and Bruno were very conscientious checked on me a few times and responded to my questions very quickly They were also available for advice and suggestions on Paris When I return to Paris I would most definitely consider staying here again,A
