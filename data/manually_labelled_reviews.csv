31203011,This was a favourite stay for us. Marietta waited up to greet us despite our late arrival due to delayed flight. It is a simple stylish space with a fabulous central location.Everyone with a large suitcase will appreciate the lift to the 3rd floor. Highly recommended!,A
35563732,"Nice and cosy apartment just as described. Conveniently located and well connected to the city centre, tourist attractions and main stations with nearby public transport, especially with Metro No. 5 just downstairs. The neighbourhood is vibrant and fun to explore, close to a lot of shops and restaurants, as well as an amazing park nearby.
Apartment itself was clean and equipped with everything we needed for a short stay. Carine has unique and tasteful furniture, not to mention her very cute set of tiny collectible items from where she had travelled, which makes the apartment feel a bit personal but also very interesting.
Carine greeted us when we arrived and was always reachable if we need anything. She even let us leave our luggage there on the last day. Overall we really enjoyed staying at Carine's. It was a very nice Parisian experience and we would surely do it again.",A

8250349,"Gilles' apartment in Paris was perfect for my husband and I. We were met on time, at the front door. After a quick tour of the VERY CLEAN apartment, we were on our own! The apartment is on the ground floor, convenient if you have a few pieces of luggage.

Everything is as pictured in the listing. The rough stone walls and wood floors brought the charm of the Le Marais neighborhood inside. All of the furnishings were in great condition and the bed was very comfortable, too. Plenty of clothing storage in the closet and under-bed drawers. 

The kitchen was fully outfitted as expected - dinnerware, pots and pans (even a wok!) and plenty of glasses for the delicious French wines. Although there is no clothes washing facilities in the apartment, there's a great little launderette just a few doors down.

The bathroom was perfect for two people - and there's plenty of hot water :-)

The neighborhood is vibrant and there are plenty of places to eat within walking distance. I'd recommend to check out the open air market across the street and the boulangerie around the corner. It's also a short walk to two Metro stops which can get you just about anywhere in Paris quickly.

All-in-all, we had a perfect time in Paris! Gilles' place will always be at the top of my list when I visit Paris.",A

Yes the flat is amazing! Literally 30 seconds walking from the tube station as well as Butte Chaumont park, the most beautiful park of Paris!
The propriety has an amazing view on the park (which you cannot really see from the pictures I think) as it's at the 9th floor (with elevator) and is bright and fresh.
The kitchen is equipped with everything you could wish to have for cooking at home and the whole apartment has been  refurbished just a few years ago.
Only thing, it can be a bit noisy during peak hours as it's facing the main road, but it's a totally worth stay*****",A

6271101,"Overall: Disappointing.  My wife and I stayed in Sidney's flat for two weeks while we eloped in Paris.  Nothing was terrible - no horror stories - but we were disappointed with our stay, the listing, and the follow through.  Here is the pro/con list:

Pro:
- Sidney's partner Max was wonderful.  He helped carry our bags up to the sixth floor when we first arrived.  He sent a number of text messages throughout our stay and did his best to address our concerns.
- The location is fantastic.  Plenty of cafes, shops, and sites within walking distance.  Very safe, very fun.
- Lots of natural light.
- Comfortable bed.

Con:
Since we were living here for two weeks, we needed four things - a washer, AC, wifi, and a kitchen.
- The washer doesn't work.  We were told that the washer didn't work after we checked in via text message.
- There is no AC.  When we asked about it, we were told it was an old building and there is not any.  Max did try and find a portable unit 10 days into our stay but was unsuccessful.
- The wifi is spotty.  It wasn't unbearable but it would go out for hours at a time.
- The hotplates are broken.  Portable hotplates were provided but the unit took up the only counter space available as it is a small kitchen.
- We never met or communicated with Sidney.  Max was fantastic but we found it strange to never communicate with the listed host.  
- Some essentials were missing.  The towels, sheets, and toilet paper were abundant but all of the soap containers (shower, hand, dish) were empty.  Cleaning supplies were also empty (paper towels, general cleaning solvent).

Overall, we were disappointed.  The flat is not as advertised and would have never come up in our search had the description been accurate.  For the price, we could have stayed in a place with all of the items we needed for a good trip.  We made do, and if you don't need a washer, AC, wifi, kitchen, and/or essentials, then this place is great.  But if you do need those items, I strongly advise you communicate with Sidney or Max with your precise needs, even if they are listed, before paying.  ",A
5668795,"Great apartment, brand new, tastefully decorated, excellent bed... ",C

Very little noise from the street (but being an apartment in the city you do get some noise from neighbours). Be quick with the shower as hot water runs out fast - apparently common in Paris apartments!
Overall an excellent stay!",A

We loved that it was super quiet in the apartment but also right in the middle of everything! We were able to walk so many places. The communication was great. You do have to walk up three floors but the stairs are super wide and it was easy to carry luggage up. I loved that the host met us at the property to show us around.

One warning is that there is a gym or school nearby so in the mornings you can hear children playing if you have the windows open like we did for fresh air. Also the shower door was rather hard to get out of, but both of these are minor things for an otherwise great apartment. 
The bed was very comfortable (esp after walking all day!) and the apartment building was beautful and safe. 
Would definitely recommend for solo or couple traveling!",A

The living room includes a comfy sofa-bed, and even though the living room is a bit small it is comfortable enough to have dinner or watch a movie. The kitchen is complete: big fridge, freezer, oven, microwave, stove and dishwasher. Toilet and bathroom are good enough, and the bedroom is very quiet as the window doesn‚Äôt face the street. A small thing to improve: wifi connectivity is good in the living room but poor in the bedroom, a different router or a signal extender might help.",B

You don't quite get the idea of that from the online pictures. Also the window overlooks a 4x4 mini courtyard surrounded by concrete walls. If you're into being out in Paris all day then this would be fine for your travels. But if you have kids and/or a lot of stuff you'll be a bit crunched.

The 7 flights of stairs to the apartment did take some getting used to, however, it was worth it for the view of the Effiel Tower from the room, peace and sun beaming inside in the morning. 

I will certainly be staying again when travelling back for work.

Even though I couldn't meet her face to face,
I could feel her sense of interior; modern, chic, and cozy.
The location is wonderful for sightseeing and having awesome lunch and dinner. Specially the restaurant of Hotel d' Amour, just in front of the house, it is a hot place to enjoy brunch. 
I've heard this area, 9em arrondissement, is post Marais, as a rising hip place, and i could see why this area is called like that. 
And this location is just the heart of it.

10334533,"Great Host. Great Place. Arnaud was friendly, flexible, and helpful. He gave us clear directions for taking the train from the airport. Easy. He also had recommendations for us for our visit to Paris. And he is a very nice guy, the little we got to know him. The appartment is BETTER than the description. Here's why: 1. Spotlessly clean. 2. Very comfortable bed. 3. Great shower. Lots of hot water, and strong water pressure. (For my fellow Americans, you can tilt the shower head up and down, twist it side to side, even raise and lower the height. I mention this because I've been in France 10 days before I figured it out.) 4. Arnaud supplies a welcome bottle of wine. He also shared coffee, salt, butter, etc. so we could settle in before we had to go shopping. 5. Windows on 2 sides so lots of light and air. Plus three little (and I do mean little) balconies. No great view. Just the neighborhood, but it's nice to be able to step out. Bottom Line: Very nice appartment for 2 or 1, relatively cheep, with good subway access for exploring Paris. But with many charms in the neighborhood to enjoy. I moved my bottom line up, because I see I gassed on and on. Keep reading if you like. The real unexpected plus to this apartment is the neighborhood. The apartment sits on a block with no cars on a street that's 2 blocks long. Tres picturesc. On the corner to the left is a plant store that displays its flowers on the street. On the corner to the right is a green grocer with fruits and vegetables on display. Also on the block is a cheese store, a butcher, an omlette restaurant - open only for lunch, a fine food take out place, a Chinese food take out place, and a domino's pizza (Porquai !). The best bakery is to the right, across the street, 4th store on the left. Buy your fresh bagett every morning ! There are also drugstores and a supermarket within 2 blocks. If you are on a student budget, there's a Paul sandwich shop where you can get a ""hero"" sandwich on a bagett for about E5.50. Or a sandwich, croissant, and a coffee for about E8.50. I guess it's comparable to our Subway shops, except there's really no comparison. (Just a note here. If you really are a high school or college student, and you want a student neighborhood, this isn't it). My wife and I are retired and on our budget we enjoyed eating at a restaurant called MOM. (Turn left to corner, then right one block). Delicious food, and hip atmosphere. Complete dinner with wine, about E30 to E40 per person. They have a bar if you want in for less money. More to explore. Walking from the apartment: #Turn right 1 and 1/2 blocks, then left on Boulevard Pereire for three long blocks, around the circle and you...",A

We felt very safe, with two door codes and a physical key to get to the room. There is a steep and narrow spiral staircase that leads up to the rooms. It can be uneven and the handrail is loose, so pulling large luggage up (like we did) is a chore. The room itself is clean, but smaller than we felt the pictures led us to believe. We were wishing we had a fan on some nights, but the window opens to an enclosed area outside so that helped some. The provided dishes worked fine for a meal in.

The place isn't huge, but there's plenty of space in the kitchen and living room areas. The bed area can be a little dark since there aren't a lot of windows, but that's about the only downside to this place. Big plus for being on the ground floor and in a quiet area.

From the warm blanket by the sofa to the beautifully appointed kitchen, we felt like pampered guests. She even had toiletries  for us. The apartment is sparkling clean and perfectly laid out for two.  The communication before and during our stay was amazing. This was our first airbnb stay and we were a little nervous, so we really appreciated all the help from Alice and Maixence! Having the Rue de Martyrs nearby was a dream. Over the course of our stay we ubered and walked countless miles in Paris, but this little neighbourhood was our favourite by a longshot. Authentic shops and people, such beauty and the food!!! Popelini cream puffs! The best strawberries I have ever eaten from the market nearby. Wine! Cheese! The area has it all.

I found it to be the perfect place to chill after sightseeing in Paris.  It‚Äôs not the place to hangout in all day, I think it‚Äôs too small for that.  Location is great, only one block from the canal and tons of local restaurants around the neighborhood.   There is a bar across the street, and the street noise could be bothersome for some, but it didn‚Äôt pose any issue for me.  I actually loved the people watching, the locals would sit at the cafe/bar in the late hours, there was a ton of energy within the neighborhood and that‚Äôs what I loved.",B

Because he had no tenants immediately before or after our stay,  he let us check in early and check out late ‚Äî very convenient for us.

We had never stayed at an AirBnb where the host lives.  We appreciate the trust, and especially leaving us enough coffee / tea / drinks in the fridge, and some snacks. The only thing that could be inconvenient is having only one key to the place but he did say the building manager could keep the key within certain hours.

Conveniently accessible to 3-4 Metro stations, a hip neighborhood vibe, boulangeries to choose from, several cafes / bars and brasseries, grocery store and street market also close by.",C

22289904,"Other guests indicated the place was clean. It was not. The floors were dirty, the refrigerator had rotted food and was packed with little room for a guest. The owner has a locked large walk in closet and stated she would empty the one near the bed. It too was filled with clothing.. only 2 dirty dusty shelves so I lived out of my suitcase. Even that was hard as her stuff was everywhere. Unlike the photo showing a nice open room, the space was filled with 2 broken chairs, a bicycle and stuff piled up every where. The wrong code for the lockbox was sent but luckily she quickly responded with the right one but after a long flight, this was annoying. The bedroom is actually in the floor below the ground floor which is a converted ‚Äôcave‚Äô. She has a dehumidifier running but it was noisy so if you turn it off at night, it gets damp.  She claims it was recently renovated but it appeared very run down and dingy.  Maybe I am too fussy in light of the other reviews and admit it was not expensive...still as I come often to Paris for work, you can find better. I suggest she perform a major declutter as there is stuff everywhere and no space for even one guest. The place needs small repairs everywhere...sagging shelves, leaking drain pipe by the toilet. Loose light switches and plugs of which many don‚Äôt work.",B
26515816,"I had a great time at Anne-Claire's place! Excellent location good places to eat near by and great transport options. It was like being at home and the big tv was very helpful considering the cold weather outside during my stay. Heating worked well, the kitchen is small but very well organised and working well.

Florent was amazing he responds almost immediately and is super helpful and checked in with us several times during our stay. There is WiFi it‚Äôs a bit slow but it‚Äôs still good. There‚Äôs a lot of great things within walking distance like a convenience store and restaurants which was a bonus because i didn‚Äôt use a rental. The street at the moment doesn‚Äôt have a lot of parking space and the space offered is metered. Overall I would say 8.9/10 Great stay!",B

Although we ate our meals out, kitchen seems well-stocked. Bathroom was very clean.  As Noemi notes, construction being done to facade but no work is done over weekend. 

Location is perfect!  Can walk to Notre Dame in 10-15 mins. Metro close by to get to other sites.  The apartment is about 1/2 block from bar/restaurant so can get noisy at night if window is open.

The host would welcome you with her generous smile, with all instructions you need about heating, water, the gate opening, etc. well mentioned and written down.
The location is strategic: on the very bottom of the building you have the Ourcq metro station. The neighborhood is calm yet full of whatever you need: cafe, restaurants, pharmacy, monoprix...
I particularly enjoyed a morning walk with my husband to the Mont Butte Chaumon, an exceptional Park in Paris which looks like on a hilltop.
Carine's home is very cosy, ideal space for two persons. The wifi is fast. I personally enjoyed a lot of details in the decoration and the books that reflects a genuinely spiritual person.

The neighborhood where the apartment is located I think it is one of the best in Paris, Saint Germain, where there are many restaurants, shops and several subway stations.It is a pleasure to walk through this neighborhood due to its history, architecture and the people who inhabit it.

The description Sebastien makes of the apartment is faithful to what one finds, is comfortable and the furniture he has are simple but good.The kitchen is equipped with everything one needs and the bathrooms are small but work well.",B

The place is quite large for Paris, with plenty of space to work and relax.  The location is ideal and she was a wonderful host.",B

10689996,"I felt immediately comfortable in this delightful apartment. Everything was top quality- the bed, the kitchen, the lighting, the bathroom and excellent shower, large windows, space to keep your stuff, places to sit. Little touches too, such as a towel rack exactly were you need it. Even a dishwasher!  Artistically designed and decorated. 

I didn't meet Juliette but she graciously allowed me a very late checkin which I needed because of train delays, and she had her Mom get me checked in. They provided me with maps and other info and recommendations about the area. ",B

19444880,"Chris's apartment is really pretty - very good for two people, there would probably be three (one person in the living room).Typical Parisian residential experience, small but fine.Chris usually lives here, so the apartment is well equipped, many pretty designer details.The kitchen is tight (2 stove plates), but completely sufficient.We slept with closed windows;It was super calm, except that you can hear the early -up neighbor walking around (not too bad).",B
3716928,"Summary:  Lovely flat, a couple of MINOR inconveniences, great location for food places and exploring Le Marais, short-to-medium walk to a few tube lines.  RECOMMENDED!

Great things:

- Lovely flat with lots of cooking ingredients, books, accessories (e.g. gloves, umbrella etc), toiletries (shower gel, toilet paper etc),

- Didn't get to meet the hosts as they were out of the country, but they made an effort to write things down for us in detail beforehand and also left detailed notes inside the flat, as well as maps.

- Some lovely food places very nearby in all directions!  One especially good one (so we've heard) right next door to the flat itself!

- A short-to-moderate (7-8min) walk to many metro stations on varying lines.

- Great location to explore Le Marais.  A ""Velib"" (Paris bike rental) station a minute's walk away.  


Inconveniences / Improvements:

- Noting that we couldn't meet the hosts as they were out of the country.... We didn't know we needed a code for the bottom door as we weren't given one.  We were VERY lucky that someone came into the column of flats at the very same time we arrived that let us in and told us the code.  

- When we came in, there was a patch on the carpet on the bed's level that was wet, probably because the roof window had been left open (for our comfort) and it had rained before we got there.  

- The lock on the main door was a little difficult to work out and get right, but after a little struggle and experimentation, we got used to it.  

-  We couldn't get the lock on the bathroom door to work (although admittedly we didn't try very hard).


OVERALL:  Recommended :)",B
3651257,‚ÄúWe had a lovely time. I especially loved the decor and her obvious love of fashion. The collection of shoes was quite impressive! We felt very welcome and the bottle of wine was a nice touch! Surprisingly we didn‚Äôt finish it since we were gone from the apartment so much of the time. We would surely recommend this place and Katia as our host‚Äù. Written by Colleen,B
8010773,"Flo's place is tiny but super cute, like the most French bachelor pad you could imagine. Don't plan on crashing on the couch clandestinely, it's too small and (as I discovered when I fell asleep there on accident one evening) pretty hard. AND keep in mind it's a ***5th*** floor walk-up, so you might want to pack light. But the flat has everything you need and you're right in the heart of Republique. Flo was super chill and quick to take care of something when I asked. I'd stay there again. Thanks!",B

It's stylishly decorated with everything you need to feel like a true Parisian :) the bed is located in the 'loft' - just take a little ladder up to it. I loved all the organic soaps in the kitchen and bathroom. We felt right at home. The flat is located in a great area - upscale shops and delicious restaurants. Check out a falafel place!

7015781,"My husband, three year old and I stayed at Valerie's place for eight days. The apartment is walking distance to train station Joffin, and some restaurants/bars. However, it is wise to note that most food establishments are closed on Sundays and Mondays outside of the center of Paris. There is a supermarket, pizza hut, and wine shops nearby.

You have to walk up five flights on winding steps to get to the apartment which is on the 5th floor (Parisians refer to it as the 4th because they count the main floor as zero) The stairs are uncomfortable to walk up when carrying luggage, or if traveling with a child. There is no lift.

The bed is loft-like, and not safe for children. Neighbors are a little noisy at times so if you're looking to sleep in, forget it.

If you don't expect much, and aren't planning on staying indoors much, then for the price‚Äìit's ok. ",B

He was on time when we arrived and had a gotten us a bottle of wine, a map, and told us about places to eat nearby.

5323999,"My husband and I stayed for 10 nights while in Paris on vacation. We picked this apartment because it looked simple and nice and was in a great location. Here's what we liked: Lea's apartment is very well located.  It's an easy walk to anywhere you want to go. There are at least two Metro stops around the corner. The Seine is a 15-minute walk. Restaurants, museums, nightlife right downstairs. The apartment is clean; the kitchen has everything you need. Here's what we didn't like (especially given that we stayed for so long): the apartment is tiny, which is probably normal for Paris. It was just a bit shocking when we first entered it. With two suitcases and two tall people, there's not much other room. The couch in the photo is a tiny love seat which barely fits two tall people. You can't have two people in the bathroom at the same time and you can barely move your arms in the shower -- you definitely can't turn. The bed is rather uncomfortable; I could feel the springs of the mattress poking out. Also, the windows of the apartment face an alley that is very loud at night, particularly on the weekends. If you're there during the weekend and want to sleep at night, forget it. If you're there for a couple of nights and are going to party all night, this is a good place for you.",B

It is on the top floor, which is a bit of a climb, but its worth the view and the quiet off the street. Thanks Anne Marie! ",B
33827090,"This is such a wonderful, cozy apartment! It's in a beautiful old building that is taken care of very well. The walls are quite thick so there is very little noise, and it's sturdy and secure. I loved my time living here and St√©phane is a fabulous host. He's kind, accommodating, explains everything well, and wverything in the apartment is exactly as advertised. There are different areas for working, including a folding table that is really nice and sturdy. If you're there for work you have the folding table as well as the table/desk in the corner. I'm always worried about not having enough desk space, but I had plenty.

Moreover, the apartment is superbly located--not too far from all of the touristy sites if you enjoy walking along the Seine, plus there are many things to do and see in the Quartier Latin, and it's very close to the Jardin des Plantes also.

The table is folded, and one chair is folded and stored in the small WC. The shower is maybe 2 feet by two feet, but the water is warm and has good pressure. This did not matter to us because we spent most of our time exploring Paris!

It is one block from a subway stop, but we also walked a lot, since it is still close to a lot of stuff.

22313560,Anne-Charlotte was really easy to communicate with and gave great directions and information. The flat is in a great location which is very close to the train station and a metro. The flat is really cute and is wonderfully decorated. The sofa bed is unfortunately pretty uncomfortable and loud. Overall we had a nice stay at Anne- Charlotte‚Äòs and can recommend it.,B
1749935,"Bertrand's place was fantastic. It had everything we needed to see Paris. It's nice and clean and large enough to feel cozy in while still being affordable.  Bertrand was timely and attentive and made two Americans feel like they could explore the best that Paris had to offer.

It's a nice 20-30 minute or so walk to the Seine and all the attractions therein. I wish we would have had more time to explore the local neighborhood because it's definitely far enough away from the touristy spots that it feels like an authentic Parisian hangout. 

My one recommendation if you stay at this area is to check out Au Passage for dinner one night. I had two of the best plates in my life there in a great atmosphere. Thanks Bertrand!",B
33467662,"Sarah's apartment is a very large mezzanine apartment with plenty of natural light.
It is in a very vibrant part of town with live bands playing out in the street on the Friday and Saturday nights when I was there which may not be everyone's cup of tea. The flat is fairly quiet due to the double glazed windows. 
It has some rough edges, dishwasher not working, towel rail broken but all in all it is a well equipped, eclectically furnished apartment that I enjoyed staying at very much.",B

There is a very comfortable full size bed in a small bedroom and the couch folds out into another comfortable bed so we could each have our own space.  The apartment is very easy walking distance from 2 metro stations, grocery is across the street and the restaurant downstairs is very good.   The neighbor hood has all you need and we were able to explore all of Paris with great ease from this location.  HIGHLY recommended!  ",B

21726168,"Stephanie's home is AWESOME. After leaving her home we thought ""we need to find a place like this in New York!"" This apartment has so much personality and is really fun to spend time in. It's a perfect place to relax after a day out. The bedroom is beautiful with the most incredible old wooden beams framing the space. 

We loved that the bathtub was tucked into a cozy corner of the bedroom. But there's also a separate shower/toilet room for those who want more privacy. The kitchen was stocked with all the important appliances, along with a great espresso machine. 

Stephanie's place is ideal for friends, couples or folks traveling alone. It's in the heart of the Marais, so as soon as you walk out the door, you're in the middle of a cool neighborhood with tons of bars, restaurants and shops.

We loved staying here and will definitely re-book when we return to Paris!",A

1810280,"A DEEP CLEAN RECOMMENDED: We started by mistaking our arrival date for a day earlier than when we actually were to arrive...Sofiane was flexible the next day by meeting with us at the planned arrival time, checking us in and making us feel welcomed into his home, offering coffee, and walking us through the layout and lighting of the room.  Know that he will stay across the hall and offer up his unit for you during your stay.  His personal items are around the unit so be aware of that as to why it is a ""private listing."" Unfortunately, after one night, we called to cancel our booking for the week.  We came to Paris for the 2015 Airbnb Open for hosts.  We knew we were taking a risk by booking with Sofiane because he has been on Airbnb for 3 years and only had 2 reviews.  We aren't sure why that is when we asked...perhaps many review would have been negative so people didn't write anything at all.  The location was perfect for the conference so we booked it. We were prepared to deal with our mild allergies of cats but when we arrived we started to smell and notice cleanliness issues with cat hair throughout this small space.  A deep cleaning of the space including the bathroom is highly recommended as well as regular vacuuming.  The biggest issue was that we notice the sheets on Sofiane's bed in the loft (you have to crawl up there, no room to stand but it is kind of romantic with the skylight) were clearly not fresh when we went to bed (a simple hard not firm mattress on the floor)...we slept despite our discomfort that night and checked out first thing in the morning after calling Airbnb to cancel.  If those things basic things such as clean sheets and a clean house (deep clean because of the cat hair) can be done, this could remain a listing in good standing. For now, we wish Sofiane the best and hope he understands these recommendations for better house-sharing behaviors of the future.  - A&C ",B
